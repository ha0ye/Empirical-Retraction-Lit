Increasingly, these dynamics have been marked by changes in scientiﬁc communication. Researchers’ attitudes toward open science, alternative models of publication and toward originality are among the elements shaping the current scientiﬁc landscape. This changing panorama reﬂects on the attitude of authors, editors and publishers toward the correction of the literature, a practice that is encountered to different extents in different ﬁelds. This practice may suggest, among several issues, commitment of the scientiﬁc community to boosting the reliability of the research record. Would the research output of countries have any association with this panorama? We analyzed 1623 retractions issued in 2013–2015 and discussed in Retraction Watch (RW), www. retractionwatch.com. These retractions account for a considerable fraction of the total of retraction notices in PubMed in the same period. They were categorized by reason, ﬁeld and country (that of the corresponding author). These retractions were distributed among 71 countries, with 15 countries accounting for a major share (85%)—most of those with the largest number of publications in the Scimago Journal & Country Rank (SJR). However, there is no consistent pattern for the relationship between ranking in SJR and ranking in number of retractions across countries in our RW dataset, which is skewed mostly by the fact that the RW website tends to post newsworthy retractions, with a bias toward biomedical and clinical sciences. This caveat notwithstanding, the prevalence of the most productive countries in our dataset of retractions is worth noting. Gradually, retractions have been permeating the dynamics of research productivity in many countries but, so far, there is limited knowledge of this interaction. We believe it should be further explored.","2018-02","2019-11-07 14:34:01","2021-06-11 19:57:29","2019-11-07 14:34:01","719-734","","2","114","","","Retractions covered by Retraction Watch in the 2013–2015 period","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/XN5EHV7B/Ribeiro and Vasconcelos - 2018 - Retractions covered by Retraction Watch in the 201.pdf","","RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Papers are retracted because of scientiﬁc misconduct or serious error. To date there have been no studies that have examined rates of retraction in nursing and midwifery journals. Design: A systematic review of Journal Citation Report listed nursing science journals. Data sources: The Medline database was searched systematically from January 1980 through July 2017, and www.retractionwatch.com was manually searched for relevant studies that met the inclusion criteria. Review methods: Two researchers undertook title and abstract and full text screening. Data were extracted on the country of the corresponding author, journal title, impact factor, study design, year of retraction, number of citations after retraction, and reason for retraction. Journals retraction index was also calculated. Results: Twenty-nine retracted papers published in nursing science journals were identiﬁed, the ﬁrst in 2007. This represents 0.029% of all papers published in these journals since 2007. We observed a signiﬁcant increase in the retraction rate of 0.44 per 10,000 publications per year (95% CI; 0.03–0.84, p = .037). There was a negative association between a journal’s retraction index and impact factor with a signiﬁcant reduction in retraction index of −0.57 for a one-point increase in impact factor (95% CI; −1.05 to −0.09, p = .022). Duplicate publication was the most common reason for retraction (n = 18, 58%). The mean number of citations manuscripts received after retraction was seven, the highest was 52. Most (n = 27, 93.1%) of the retracted papers are still available online (with a watermark indicating they are retracted). Conclusion: Compared to more established academic disciplines, rates of retraction in nursing and midwifery are low. Findings suggest that unsound research is not being identiﬁed and that the checks and balances incumbent in the scientiﬁc method are not working. In a clinical discipline, this is concerning and may indicate that research that should have been removed from the evidence base continues to inﬂuence nursing and midwifery care.","2018-05","2019-11-07 14:30:26","2021-06-11 19:57:29","2019-11-07 14:30:26","8-13","","","81","","","Retraction of publications in nursing and midwifery research","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/4XTGJQSJ/Al-Ghareeb et al. - 2018 - Retraction of publications in nursing and midwifer.pdf","","RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10; systematic reviews of retracted papers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article reports a study conducted to identify RN textual features that can be used to disambiguate obscured authorship, ascertain the extent of authorship evasion in RNs from two disciplinary clusters, and determine if the disciplines varied in the distributions of different types of RN authorship. Drawing on a corpus of 370 RNs archived in the Web of Science for the hard discipline of Cell Biology and the soft disciplines of Business, Finance, and Management, this study has identiﬁed 25 types of textual markers that can be used to disambiguate authorship, and revealed that only 25.68% of the RNs could be unambiguously attributed to authors of the retracted articles alone or jointly and that authorship could not be determined for 28.92% of the RNs. Furthermore, the study has found marked disciplinary differences in the different categories of RN authorship.

We aim to: (a) describe the reasons for retraction of genetics articles and the time elapsed between the publication of an article and that of the retraction notice because of research misconduct (ie, fabrication, falsification, plagiarism); and (b) compare all these variables between retracted medical genetics (MG) and non-medical genetics (NMG) articles. Methods  All retracted genetics articles published between 1970 and 2018 were retrieved from the Retraction Watch database. The reasons for retraction were fabrication/falsification, plagiarism, duplication, unreliability, and authorship issues. Articles subject to investigation by company/institution, journal, US Office for Research Integrity or third party were also retrieved. Results  1582 retracted genetics articles (MG, n=690; NMG, n=892) were identified . Research misconduct and duplication were involved in 33% and 24% of retracted papers, respectively; 37% were subject to investigation. Only 0.8% of articles involved both fabrication/ falsification and plagiarism. In this century the incidence of both plagiarism and duplication increased statistically significantly in genetics retracted articles; conversely, fabrication/falsification was significantly reduced. Time to retraction due to scientific misconduct was statistically significantly shorter in the period 2006–2018 compared with 1970–2000. Fabrication/falsification was statistically significantly more common in NMG (28%) than in MG (19%) articles. MG articles were significantly more frequently investigated (45%) than NMG articles (31%). Time to retraction of articles due to fabrication/ falsification was significantly shorter for MG (mean 4.7 years) than for NMG (mean 6.4 years) articles; no differences for plagiarism (mean 2.3 years) were found. The USA (mainly NMG articles) and China (mainly MG articles) accounted for the largest number of retracted articles. Conclusion  Genetics is a discipline with a high article retraction rate (estimated retraction rate 0.15%). Fabrication/falsification and plagiarism were almost mutually exclusive reasons for article retraction. Retracted MG articles were more frequently subject to investigation than NMG articles. Retracted articles due to fabrication/falsification required 2.0–2.8 times longer to retract than when plagiarism was involved.","2019-11","2019-11-07 14:30:20","2021-06-11 19:57:29","2019-11-07 14:30:20","734-740","","11","56","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/IVJTZKHA/Dal-Ré and Ayuso - 2019 - Reasons for and time to retraction of genetics art.pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/TJREI2UK/Dal-Ré and Ayuso - 2019 - Reasons for and time to retraction of genetics art.pdf; ; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/HQR8GEGJ/734.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31300549","RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The full text was screened to see the type of post-retraction citation (positive/negative) and whether the cited article appears or not as retracted. One hundred and two retractions were identified, representing 3.5% of the retracted articles indexed by PubMed, out of which 54 were included in the analysis. Half of the articles were retracted in the first 24 months after publication, and the number of post retraction citations was higher than the number of citations before retraction in 30 out of 54 cases (US methods: 9/20, other diagnostic methods 21/34, P-value = 0.2312). The plagiarism was the most common reason for retraction (31%), followed by repetitive publication (26%), and errors in data/manuscript (24%). In less than 2% of cases, the retracted articles appear as retracted in the text or reference list, while the negative citation is observed in 4.84% among manuscripts reporting an US diagnostic method and 0.32% among manuscripts reporting a diagnostic method other than US (P-value = 0.0004). No significant differences were observed when post retraction weighted citation index (WCI, no. of citations weighted by citation window) was compared to WCI prior retraction (P-value = 0.5972). In light of the reported results, we enumerated some recommendations that could potentially minimize the referral to retracted studies as valid.","2019-06-13","2019-11-07 14:30:17","2021-06-11 19:57:29","2019-11-07 14:30:17","e0217918","","6","14","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/85SDVBLK/Bolboacă et al. - 2019 - Post retraction citations among manuscripts report.pdf","","citation studies; RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10","","Glanzel, Wolfgang","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Retracted articles from the KoreaMed database were collected on January 28, 2016. Scopus and KoMCI were searched for post-retraction citations, which were defined as citations 1 year after the retraction, excluding retraction-related citations. Results: The 114 retracted articles were found in KoreaMed. The proportion of retracted articles in KoreaMed, the Korean medical journal database, through January 2016 was 0.04% (114/256,000). On the journal homepage, a retraction mark was present for 49 of the 114 retracted articles. Of the 114 retracted articles, 45 were cited in Scopus 176 times. Of the 176 citations, 109 (of 36 retracted articles) were post-retraction citations. The number of citations in KoMCI, except for citations of retraction notices, was 33 (of 14 retracted articles). Of those citations, the number of post-retraction citations in KoMCI was 14 (of 8 retracted articles). The presence of a retraction mark did not influence post-retraction citations (P > 0.05). Post-retraction citations were frequent in the range of 1 to 3 years.

Methods and Materials: A list of previously identiﬁed retracted articles within the ﬁeld of radiation oncology was updated in June 2017. The number of publications citing retracted articles was quantiﬁed using Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus. Studies citing retracted publications after publication of the retraction note were individually assessed to determine the nature of the reference. Results: Forty-seven retracted articles were identiﬁed for this study. Thirty-seven studies (79%) received 1017 citations before retraction, and 34 articles (72%) received 407 English and 169 foreign-language citations afterward. The average number of citations dropped from 22 to 11 after publication of the retraction note (95% conﬁdence interval, 0.3-21.0, P Z .043). Most postretraction citations occurred during the second year after the article’s retraction, originated from North America and Asia (N Z 124 each, 31%) and Europe (N Z 122, 30%), and featured in original articles (N Z 254, 62%) and reviews (N Z 73, 18%). Of the 358 individually evaluable citing studies, 92% referenced the retracted article as legitimate work. Three guidelines and 15 systematic reviews and meta-analyses were also identiﬁed that cited retracted articles as valid work. Conclusions: Postretraction citations are an avoidable phenomenon. The results of the study emphasize the need for investigators to adhere to good research practices to mitigate the inﬂuence and propagation of ﬂawed and unethical research. Journal editors, peer reviewers, and the broader radiation oncology readership should remain diligent in ensuring that citations of retracted work are identiﬁed and removed before, during, and possibly even after publication.

To curb this problem, the Indian government has initiated a number of measures, such as providing plagiarism detecting software to all the universities for free. Still, however, many unfair or incorrect papers are published. For some time, publishers have used an efficient tool to deal with such situations: retractions. A published paper that is later discovered to not deserve publication—which can be for a number of reasons—can be withdrawn (and often removed from the online contents of the journal) by the publisher. This study aims (1) to identify retracted publications authored or co-authored by researchers affiliated to Indian institutions and (2) to analyze the reasons for the retractions. To meet these aims, we searched the SCOPUS database to identify retraction notices for articles authored or coauthored by Indian authors. The first retraction notice was issued back in 1996, an exceptionally early retraction, as the next one was published in 2005. Thus, we analyzed 239 retractions (195 from journals and 44 from conference proceedings) published between 2005 and 3 August 2018 (but most were published after 2010), in terms of the following qualitative retraction-wise parameters: the main reason for retraction, authorship, a collaboration level, collaborating countries, sources of retraction (a journal or conference proceedings), and funding sources of the research. We also detected journals with high retraction frequencies. Mainly two phrases—“Retraction notice to” and “Retracted Article”—were used to retract publications. The most frequent reason for retractions was plagiarism.","2019-05","2019-11-07 14:29:53","2021-06-11 19:57:29","2019-11-07 14:29:53","1081-1094","","2","119","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/QLT6RCD4/Elango et al. - 2019 - Analysis of retractions in Indian science.pdf","","RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed), PubMed Central, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases for dental retracted articles from database inception to 02 July 2018. In addition, we scanned the search engine Google Scholar, and the website, Retraction Watch (www.retractionwatch.com), for retracted dental articles. Two researchers independently screened titles, abstracts and full text of search results. Descriptive data was collected on each retracted article including reason for retraction, study type, journal impact factor, and time between publication and retraction. Regression models were used to evaluate the association between journal impact factor and retraction characteristics. Results: A total of 138 retractions of dental articles were included. Reasons for retraction were misconduct (N = 100, 72.5%), with the most frequently reported misconduct being overlap/plagiarism and innacurate/ falsified conducting and reporting (N = 53, 38.4%). In vitro (N = 39, 28.3%), case reports (N = 29, 21%) and narrative reviews (N = 19, 13.8%) were study design most frequently identified in retracted articles. The median time between article publication and date of retraction notice was 1 year (interquartile-range [IQR] = 0–2 years). More than half of the retracted articles (n = 82, 59.4%) were cited post-retraction. A retracted article reporting a randomized controlled trial was more likely to appear in journal with higher impact factor than a retracted case report (mean difference [MD] = 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2,3.1. Articles retracted after 2012 were likely to appear in journals with a lower impact factor (MD=−1.3; 95%CI=−1.8, 0.8). Conclusions: Research misconduct is the main reason for retraction of dental articles. A substantial proportion of these articles were still being cited after their retraction. Clinical Significance: This report of dental retraction articles informs that more transparency is needed with data reporting in dentistry to improve writing practices in dentistry. A more complete report of retractions and their causes would provide more accurate information to inform researchers and editors to avoid or reduce future cases of retractions. More complete and accurate reporting would increase the overall trust in dental research.","2018-12","2019-11-07 14:29:44","2021-06-11 19:56:18","2019-11-07 14:29:44","19-23","","","79","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/IAJYB3QY/Faggion Jr et al. - 2018 - An analysis of retractions of dental publications.pdf","","RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, publications and papers accumulate an altmetric attention score, which is a complementary metric to citationbased metrics. We used the citations, Journal Impact Factor, time between publication and retraction and the reasons behind retraction in order to find determinants of the retracted papers´ altmetric attention score. To find these determinants we compared two samples, one of retractions with top altmetric attention scores and one of retractions with altmetric attention scores chosen at random. We used a binary choice model to estimate the probability of being retracted due to misconduct or error. The model shows positive effects of altmetric scores and the time between publication and retraction on the probability to be retracted due to misconduct in the top sample. We conclude that there is an association between retraction due to misconduct and higher altmetric attention scores within the top sample.","2019-05-08","2019-11-07 14:28:00","2021-06-11 19:57:29","2019-11-07 14:28:00","98-110","","2-3","70","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/2LEP9EQ8/Shema et al. - 2019 - Retractions from altmetric and bibliometric perspe.pdf","","altmetrics; RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence, this study investigated the correction and retraction practices of LIS journals. Journals included in the Web of Science’s information science and library science subject category were selected for the study and the characteristics of the articles corrected or retracted in those journals between 1996 and 2016 were examined. Findings show that there were 517 corrections and five retractions in LIS journals during the period. Most of the corrections made to articles in LIS journals were minor while the reasons for article retraction included plagiarism, duplication, irreproducible results and methodological errors. Our findings also reveal that on average it took about 587 days for an article to be retracted while some of the retracted articles continued to be cited after retraction. The study concluded that the average number of errors per correction was lower than what had been observed in medical journals while some of the retracted articles continued to receive positive post-retraction citations. It also recommended the inclusion of a check on the validity of literature cited by authors at the review stage as part of the quality control mechanism by publishers of LIS journals.","2020","2019-11-07 14:30:02","2021-06-11 20:57:40","2019-11-11 04:00:29","169-183","","1","52","","Journal of Librarianship and Information Science","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","First online July 11, 2018","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/K6C77KCH/Ajiferuke and Adekannbi - 2018 - Correction and retraction practices in library and.pdf","","RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10; systematic reviews of retracted papers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this review was to evaluate the reasons for and the rate of article retraction in the field of anesthesia within the last 30 years.MethodsBased on a reproducible search strategy, two independent reviewers searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Retraction Watch website to identify retracted anesthesiology articles. Extracted data included: author names, year of publication, year of the retracted article, journal name, journal five-year impact factor, research type (clinical, basic science, or review), reason for article retraction, number of citations, and presence of a watermark indicating article retraction.ResultsThree hundred and fifty articles were included for data extraction. Reasons for article retraction could be grouped into six broad categories. The most common reason for retraction was fraud (data fabrication or manipulation), which accounted for nearly half (49.4%) of all retractions, followed by lack of appropriate ethical approval (28%). Other reasons for retraction included publication issues (e.g., duplicate publications), plagiarism, and studies with methodologic or other non-fraud data issues. Four authors were associated with most of the retracted articles (59%). The majority (69%) of publications utilized a watermark on the original article to indicate that the article was retracted. Journal Citation Reports journal impact factors ranged from 0.9 to 48.1 (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 3.6 [2.5–4.0]), and the most cited article was referenced 197 times (median [IQR], 13 [5–26]). Most retracted articles (66%) were cited at least once by other journal articles after having been withdrawn.ConclusionsMost retracted articles in anesthesiology literature were retracted because of research misconduct. Limited information is available in the retraction notices, unless explicitly stated, so it is challenging to distinguish between an honest error and research misconduct. Therefore, a standardized reporting process with structured retraction notices is desired.","2020","2019-11-11 14:46:59","2021-06-11 21:02:40","2019-11-11 14:46:59","57-63","","","67","","Can J Anesth/J Can Anesth","Reasons for article retraction in anesthesiology","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","Online 2019-10-15","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/YGV5D2HC/Nair et al. - 2019 - Reasons for article retraction in anesthesiology .pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/ZL447UDT/Nair et al. - 2020 - Reasons for article retraction in anesthesiology .pdf","","RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we examine various trends among 2,375 articles retracted due to misconduct in all scholarly ﬁelds. Proportions of articles retracted due to ‘‘publication misconduct’’ (primarily plagiarism and duplicate publication) or ‘‘distrust data or interpretations’’ (primarily research artifacts and unexplained irreproducibility of data) differ signiﬁcantly between PubMed (35 and 59 %, respectively) and non-PubMed (56 and 27 %) articles and between English- and non-English-speaking author afﬁliation countries. Retraction rates due to any form of misconduct, adjusted for the size of the literature in different disciplines, vary from 0.22 per 100,000 articles in the Humanities to 7.58 in Medicine and 7.69 in Chemistry. The annual rate of article retractions due to misconduct has increased exponentially since 2001, and the percentage of all retractions involving misconduct allegations has grown from 18.5–29.2 % for each year from 1990–1993 to 55.8–71.9 % for each year from 2007–2010. Despite these increases, the prominence of research integrity in the news media has not changed appreciably over the past 20 years. Articles retracted due to misconduct are found in all major scholarly disciplines. The higher rate of plagiarism among authors from non-English speaking countries may diminish if institutions improved their support for the writing of English manuscripts by their scholars. The training of junior scholars on proper codes of research (and publishing) conduct should be embraced by all disciplines, not just by biomedical ﬁelds where the perception of misconduct is high.","2013-08","2019-11-10 17:45:40","2021-06-11 19:57:29","2019-11-10 16:20:25","573-587","","2","96","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/CGQN957P/Zhang and Grieneisen - 2013 - The impact of misconduct on the published medical .pdf","","EPPI Reviewer Article; media research related to retracted papers; retraction and ORI cases; RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study was to determine the rate of retractions and identify the reasons for retracted publications in the orthopaedic literature. Methods Two reviewers independently searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (1995 to current) using MeSH keyword headings and the ‘retracted’ filter. We also searched an independent website that reports and archives retracted scientific publications (www. retractionwatch.com). Two reviewers independently extracted data including reason for retraction, study type, journal impact factor, and country of origin. Results One hundred and ten retracted studies were included for data extraction. The retracted studies were published in journals with impact factors ranging from 0.000 (discontinued journals) to 13.262. In the 20-year search window, only 25 papers were retracted in the first ten years, with the remaining 85 papers retracted in the most recent decade. The most common reasons for retraction were fraudulent data (29), plagiarism (25) and duplicate publication (20). Retracted articles have been cited up to 165 times (median 6; interquartile range 2 to 19). Conclusion The rate of retractions in the orthopaedic literature is increasing, with the majority of retractions attributed to academic misconduct and fraud. Orthopaedic retractions originate from numerous journals and countries, indicating that misconduct issues are widespread. The results of this study highlight the need to address academic integrity when training the next generation of orthopaedic investigators.","2016-06","2019-11-10 17:45:40","2021-06-11 19:57:29","2019-11-10 16:20:24","263-268","","6","5","","","Retractions in orthopaedic research","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/VNLXRCPX/Yan et al. - 2016 - Retractions in orthopaedic research A systematic .pdf","","EPPI Reviewer Article; RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10; systematic reviews of retracted papers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods and Materials: Computerized searches were performed in Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Ovid EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library up to May 2017 looking for retracted studies using the terms “retraction note,” “retracted note,” “withdrawn” and “radiotherapy,” and “radiation oncology.” Additional studies were identiﬁed by hand-searching 10 discipline-speciﬁc journals. Two authors independently screened papers and then extracted author demographics, journal characteristics, and retraction-speciﬁc variables. Results: Of the 58 studies identiﬁed, the most common reasons for retraction were misconduct (43%), methodological error (21%), authorship issues (5%), unknown causes (5%), and journal (administrative) errors (3%). A total of 13 systematic reviews or protocols (22%) were withdrawn from the Cochrane Library for being out-of-date or redundant. All but one retracted study and retraction notice were available in portable document format. Of the 57 retrieved papers, 79% were identiﬁed as retracted via in-text notations or watermarks.

An increase in the occurrence of retractions in recent years has been reported. Nevertheless, there is scarce information on this topic concerning publications in dentistry and related specialties. Thus, this study aimed to investigate retracted papers published in dental journals. Methods:  Data collection included an exploratory search in PubMed and a specific search in SCImago Journal Rank indexed journals, complemented by the cases reported on the Retraction Watch website and in PubMed. All 167 den‑tal journals included in SCImago were searched for identification of retracted articles up to March 2016. The selected retracted articles and their corresponding retraction notices were recorded and assessed for classification according to the reason for retraction and other additional information. Results:  Forty of the 167 journals scrutinised at SCImago (23.9%) had at least one retracted article, and four addi‑tional journals were identified from the Retraction Watch website. A total of 72 retracted found were retracted for the reasons: redundant publication (20.8%), plagiarism (18.1%), misconduct (13.8%), overlap (13.6%) and honest error (9.7%). Higher number of retractions were reported in those journals with cites/doc <2.0—n = 49 (74.2%). The types of studies were mainly laboratory studies (34.7%), case reports (22.2%) and review articles (13.9%). Conclusions:  The approach to ethical problems in papers published in dental scientific journals is still incipient; retractions were mostly due to the authors’ malpractice and were more frequently related to journals with less impact.","2017-12","2019-11-10 17:45:40","2021-06-11 19:57:29","2019-11-10 16:19:57","","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/KQVZ6GM6/_EPPI-Reviewer Coding Report.pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/SE34IHKJ/Nogueira et al. - 2017 - A survey of retracted articles in dentistry.pdf","","EPPI Reviewer Article; RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10; systematic reviews of retracted papers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data source and study selection: All retractions of English language publications indexed in MEDLINE between 1982 and 2002 were extracted. Data extraction: Two reviewers categorised the reasons for retraction of each article as misconduct (falsification, fabrication, or plagiarism) or unintentional error (mistakes in sampling, procedures, or data analysis; failure to reproduce findings; accidental omission of information about methods or data analysis). Data synthesis: Of the 395 articles retracted between 1982 and 2002, 107 (27.1%) were retracted because of scientific misconduct, 244 (61.8%) because of unintentional errors, and 44 (11.1%) could not be categorised. Compared with articles retracted because of misconduct, articles with unintentional mistakes were more likely to have multiple authors, no reported funding source, and to be published in frequently cited journals. They were more likely to be retracted by the author(s) of the article, and the retraction was more likely to occur more promptly (mean, 2.0 years; 95% CI, 1.8–2.2) than articles withdrawn because of misconduct (mean, 3.3 years; 95% CI, 2.7–3.9) (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). Conclusions: Retractions in the biomedical literature were more than twice as likely to result from unintentional mistakes than from scientific misconduct. The different characteristics of articles retracted for misconduct and for mistakes reflect distinct causes and, potentially, distinct solutions.","2006-08","2019-11-10 17:45:40","2021-06-11 19:57:29","2019-11-10 16:19:51","152-154","","3","185","","","Retractions in the research literature","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/9MB26M66/_EPPI-Reviewer Coding Report.pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/VU475HT2/Nath et al. - 2006 - Retractions in the research literature misconduct.pdf","","EPPI Reviewer Article; reasons for retraction; RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods We reviewed 10 major oncology journals to determine variability in the online presentation of errata. Canadian oncologists were surveyed regarding characteristics that may influence error propagation. Errors published during 2004–2007 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology (jco) and the Journal of the National Cancer Institute (jnci) were classified as trivial or serious (that is, whether change in outcome was involved). The frequency of citation and error propagation was determined for serious errors. Results Of the 10 journals reviewed, 9 present links from the original article to the erratum; in 4 of those 9 journals, at least 1 link was missing. Survey results indicate that 33% of oncologists do not read errata, and 45% have read only the abstract when referencing an article. Although 59% of oncologists have noticed errors in cancer publications, only 13% reported the error. Together, jco and jnci published 190 errata, for an error rate of 4% ± 1% (standard deviation) annually; 26 of 190 errors were serious (14%). The median time from publication of the article to the corresponding erratum was 3.5 months for trivial errors as compared with 8.3 months for serious errors (p = 0.03). Error propagation in citations before and after publication of the erratum was 15% and 2% respectively (p < 0.01).

The primary outcomes were the characteristics and distribution of retracted articles and the reasons for retractions. The secondary outcomes included how article retractions were handled by journals and how to improve the journal practices toward article retractions. Results: We included 1,339 retracted articles. Most retracted articles had six authors or fewer. Article retraction was most common in the USA (26%), Japan (11%) and Germany (10%). The main reasons for article retraction were misconduct (51%, n = 685) and error (14%, n = 193). There were 66% (n = 889) of retracted articles having male senior or corresponding authors. Of the articles retracted after August 2010, 63% (n = 567) retractions were reported on Retraction Watch. Large discrepancies were observed in the ways that different journals handled article retractions. For instance, articles were completely withdrawn from some journals, while in others, articles were still available with no indication of retraction. Likewise, some retraction notices included a detailed account of the events that led to article retraction, while others only consisted of a statement indicating the article retraction. Conclusion: The characteristics, geographic distribution and reasons for retraction of published articles involving human research participants were examined in this survey. More efforts are needed to improve the consistency and transparency of journal practices toward article retractions.","2018-01","2019-11-10 17:45:40","2021-06-11 19:57:29","2019-11-10 16:19:37","39-47","","","Volume 11","","","Exploring the characteristics, global distribution and reasons for retraction of published articles involving human research participants","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/RTMEL743/_EPPI-Reviewer Coding Report.pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/8953NWXF/Li et al. - 2018 - Exploring the characteristics, global distribution.pdf","","EPPI Reviewer Article; RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10; systematic reviews of retracted papers; systematic reviews of retracted papers - method/topical beyond field","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The number of retracted articles has increased dramatically over the past 20 years and now comprises about .02% of the 2 million articles published each year. Retraction of publications available in large public databases can be analyzed as an objective measure for scientific misconduct and errors. In this project, we analyzed retractions of scientific publications using the Web of Science (WoS) and PubMed databases. We found that a power law is applicable to distributions of retracting authors and retracted publications with exponents of about −.6 and −3.0, respectively. Application of a power-law model for retracted publications implies that retraction is not a random event. Analysis of the retraction distributions suggests that a small fraction (1–2%) of retracting authors with ≧5 retractions are responsible for around 10% of retraction. The probabilities for their repeating retraction are calculated using a statistical model: 3–5% likelihood of repeat retraction for authors with a single retraction at five years after the latest retraction and 26–37% for authors with five retractions at five years after the latest retraction. By focusing on those with repeated retractions, this analysis could contribute to identification of measures to reduce such repetition of retractions.","2018-05-19","2019-11-10 17:45:40","2021-06-11 19:57:29","2019-11-10 16:19:35","212-219","","4","25","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/B7YLAAE9/_EPPI-Reviewer Coding Report.pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/XAYH2U3G/Kuroki and Ukawa - 2018 - Repeating probability of authors with retracted sc.pdf","","authors of retracted papers; EPPI Reviewer Article; RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In an analysis of over two million words, we evaluated 253 publications retracted for fraudulent data and compared the linguistic style of each paper to a corpus of 253 unretracted publications and 62 publications retracted for reasons other than fraud (e.g., ethics violations). Fraudulent papers were written with significantly higher levels of linguistic obfuscation, including lower readability and higher rates of jargon than unretracted and nonfraudulent papers. We also observed a positive association between obfuscation and the number of references per paper, suggesting that fraudulent authors obfuscate their reports to mask their deception by making them more costly to analyze and evaluate.

This study explored the characteristics of retractions in medical journals published in Korea through the KoreaMed database. Methods We retrieved retraction articles indexed in the KoreaMed database from January 1990 to January 2016. Three authors each reviewed the details of the retractions including the reason for retraction, adherence to retraction guidelines, and appropriateness of retraction. Points of disagreement were reconciled by discussion among the three. Results Out of 217,839 articles in KoreaMed published from 1990 to January 2016, the publication type of 111 articles was retraction (0.051%). Of the 111 articles (addressing the retraction of 114 papers), 58.8% were issued by the authors, 17.5% were jointly issued (author, editor, and publisher), 15.8% came from editors, and 4.4% were dispatched by institutions; in 5.3% of the instances, the issuer was unstated. The reasons for retraction included duplicate publication (57.0%), plagiarism (8.8%), scientific error (4.4%), author dispute (3.5%), and other (5.3%); the reasons were unstated or unclear in 20.2%. The degree of adherence to COPE’s retraction guidelines varied (79.8%–100%), and some retractions were inappropriate by COPE standards. These were categorized as follows: retraction of the first published article in the case of duplicate publication (69.2%), authorship dispute (15.4%), errata (7.7%), and other (7.7%). Conclusion The major reason for retraction in Korean medical journals is duplicate publication. Some retractions resulted from overreaction by the editors.

Our goal was to examine retracted surgical papers. Methods: NCBI PubMed database was queried using the search terms “surgery,” “surg,” or “surgical” and “retracted” or “retraction.” Article details were recorded. Results: There were 184 retracted surgical articles identiﬁed from 1991 through 2015. Average retraction time was 3.6 years. General (26%), Cardiac (22%), and Orthopedic (10%) surgery were most common. Reasons for retraction were duplication (35.3%), Institutional Review Board violations (18.5%), falsiﬁed data (14.7%), data errors (9.8%), author dispute (8.2%), plagiarism (7.6%), copyright violations (2.2%), ﬁnancial disclosure violations (0.5%), and consent (0.5%). No reason for retraction was given in 8.7% of cases. Median IF was higher for administrative than content-related retraction reasons (3.0 vs. 2.0, P < 0.01).

To analyze publication activity and citation profiles of countries, multidisciplinary, and specialized biomedical journals, we referred to the latest data from the SCImago Journal & Country Rank database. Total number of indexed articles and values of the h-index of the fifty most productive countries and multidisciplinary journals were recorded and linked to the number of duplicate and retracted publications in PubMed. Results Our analysis found 2597 correction items. A striking increase in the number of corrections appeared in 2013, which is mainly due to 871 (85.3%) corrections from PLOS One. The number of duplicate publications was 1086. Articles frequently published in duplicate were reviews (15.6%), original studies (12.6%), and case reports (7.6%), whereas top three retracted articles were original studies (10.1%), randomized trials (8.8%), and reviews (7%). A strong association existed between the total number of publications across countries and duplicate (rs = 0.86, P < 0.001) and retracted items (rs = 0.812, P < 0.001). A similar trend was found between country-based h-index values and duplicate and retracted publications. Conclusion The study suggests that the intensified self-correction in biomedicine is due to the attention of readers and authors, who spot errors in their hub of evidence-based information.

Past surveys of the retracted literature each limited their scope to articles in PubMed, though many retracted articles are not indexed in PubMed. To understand the scope and characteristics of retracted articles across the full spectrum of scholarly disciplines, we surveyed 42 of the largest bibliographic databases for major scholarly fields and publisher websites to identify retracted articles. This study examines various trends among them. Results: We found, 4,449 scholarly publications retracted from 1928–2011. Unlike Math, Physics, Engineering and Social Sciences, the percentages of retractions in Medicine, Life Science and Chemistry exceeded their percentages among Web of Science (WoS) records. Retractions due to alleged publishing misconduct (47%) outnumbered those due to alleged research misconduct (20%) or questionable data/interpretations (42%). This total exceeds 100% since multiple justifications were listed in some retraction notices. Retraction/WoS record ratios vary among author affiliation countries. Though widespread, only miniscule percentages of publications for individual years, countries, journals, or disciplines have been retracted. Fifteen prolific individuals accounted for more than half of all retractions due to alleged research misconduct, and strongly influenced all retraction characteristics. The number of articles retracted per year increased by a factor of 19.06 from 2001 to 2010, though excluding repeat offenders and adjusting for growth of the published literature decreases it to a factor of 11.36. Conclusions: Retracted articles occur across the full spectrum of scholarly disciplines. Most retracted articles do not contain flawed data; and the authors of most retracted articles have not been accused of research misconduct. Despite recent increases, the proportion of published scholarly literature affected by retraction remains very small. Articles and editorials discussing retractions, or their relation to research integrity, should always consider individual cases in these broad contexts. However, better mechanisms are still needed for raising researchers’ awareness of the retracted literature in their field.","2012-10-24","2019-11-10 17:45:40","2021-06-11 19:57:29","2019-11-10 16:22:51","e44118","","10","7","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/TRFGWHXA/_EPPI-Reviewer Coding Report.pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/C2HCSHMT/Grieneisen and Zhang - 2012 - A Comprehensive Survey of Retracted Articles from .pdf","","characteristics of retracted papers - database perspective; EPPI Reviewer Article; RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10; revisit","","von Elm, Erik","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While research errors are as relevant to the knowledge economy as defects are to the manufacturing economy, mechanisms to identify and signal “defective” or false knowledge are poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate one such institution – the system of scientiﬁc retractions. We analyze the universe of peer-reviewed scientiﬁc articles retracted from the biomedical literature between 1972–2006 and comparing with a matched control sample in order to identify the correlates, timing, and causal impact of scientiﬁc retractions. This effort provides insight into the workings of a distributed, peer-based system for the governance of validity in scientiﬁc knowledge. Our ﬁndings suggest that attention is a key predictor of retraction – retracted articles arise most frequently among highly-cited articles. The retraction system is expeditious in uncovering knowledge that is ever determined to be false (the mean time to retraction is less than two years) and democratic (retraction is not systematically affected by author prominence). Lastly, retraction causes an immediate, severe, and long-lived decline in future citations. Conditional on the obvious limitation that we cannot measure the absolute amount of false science in circulation, these results support the view that distributed governance systems can be designed to uncover false knowledge relatively swiftly and to mitigate the costs that false knowledge for future generations of producers.","2012-03","2019-11-10 17:45:40","2021-06-11 19:57:29","2019-11-10 16:22:42","276-290","","2","41","","","Governing knowledge in the scientific community","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/FZD76IDI/_EPPI-Reviewer Coding Report.pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/XDT4G32Y/Furman et al. - 2012 - Governing knowledge in the scientific community E.pdf","","econometric studies of retraction; EPPI Reviewer Article; field impact; RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10; revisit","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design: Descriptive cross-sectional study. Population: 88 articles (18 journals) by the anaesthesiologist Dr. Boldt, that warranted retraction. Method: According to the recommendations of the Committee on Publication Ethics, we regarded a retraction as adequate when a retraction notice was published, linked to the retracted article, identified the title and authors of the retracted article in its heading, explained the reason and who took responsibility for the retraction, and when the retracted article was freely accessible and marked using a transparent watermark that preserved original content. Two authors extracted data independently (January 2013) and contacted editors-in-chief and publishers for clarification in cases of inadequate retraction. Results: Five articles (6%) fulfilled all criteria for adequate retraction. Nine (10%) were not retracted (no retraction notice published, full text article not marked). 79 (90%) retraction notices were published, 76 (86%) were freely accessible, but only 15 (17%) were complete. 73 (83%) full text articles were marked as retracted, of which 14 (16%) had an opaque watermark hiding parts of the original content, and 11 (13%) had all original content deleted. 59 (67%) retracted articles were freely accessible. One editor-in-chief stated personal problems as a reason for incomplete retractions, eight blamed their publishers. Two publishers cited legal threats from Dr. Boldt’s co-authors which prevented them from retracting articles. Conclusion: Guidelines for retracting articles are incompletely followed. The role of publishers in the retraction process needs to be clarified and standards are needed on marking retracted articles. It remains unclear who should check that retractions are done properly. Legal safeguards are required to allow retraction of articles against the wishes of authors.","2014-01-22","2019-11-10 17:45:40","2021-06-11 19:57:29","2019-11-10 16:22:26","e85846","","1","9","","","Fate of articles that warranted retraction due to ethical concerns","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/2IF76ZCZ/_EPPI-Reviewer Coding Report.pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/HZH5CSWM/Elia et al. - 2014 - Fate of Articles That Warranted Retraction Due to .pdf","","are articles with known problems retracted; EPPI Reviewer Article; RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10; systematic reviews of retracted papers - author perspective","","Wray, K.

Retractions used to be handled following informal practices until they were formalized in 2009 by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). The objective of our study was to describe the compliance to these guidelines. Methods: All retractions published in 2008 were identified using the Medline publication type “retraction of publication”. The notices of retraction and the original articles were retrieved. For each retraction, we identified the reason for retraction, the country of affiliation of the first author, the time to retraction, the impact factor of the journal and the mention of retraction on the original article. Results: Overall, 244 retractions were considered for analysis. Formal retraction notices could not be retrieved for 9. Of the 235 retractions available (96%), the reason was not detailed for 21 articles (9%). The most cited reasons were mistakes (28%), plagiarism (20%), fraud (14%) and overlap (11%). The original paper or its location was found for 233 retractions (95%). Of these, 22% were available with no mention of the retraction. Conclusion: A standard retraction form could be helpful, with a check list of major reason, leaving the editor free to provide the reader with any further information. Original articles should remain available with a clear mention of the retraction.","2013-12","2019-11-10 17:45:40","2021-06-11 19:57:29","2019-11-10 16:22:18","238","","1","6","","","Visibility of retractions","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/VE4AF8N9/_EPPI-Reviewer Coding Report.pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/RJDXUL28/Decullier et al. - 2013 - Visibility of retractions a cross-sectional one-y.pdf","","EPPI Reviewer Article; RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10; visibility of retraction status","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the major mechanisms of self-correction is retraction of flawed work. Aim: To study the various parameters associated with retraction of scientific articles in 2012 and 2013 and discuss the current trends in article retraction over the period of 2 years. Materials and Methods: Data were retrieved from MEDLINE (via PubMed) using the keywords retraction of articles, retraction notice, and withdrawal of article in January 2014, and analysis of articles published in 2012 and 2013 was carried out. Results: A total of 155 articles in 2012 and 182 in 2013 were retracted, and original articles followed by case reports constituted major part of it. The most cited reasons for retraction were mistakes, plagiarism, and duplicate submission, and the time interval between submission and retraction had reduced in 2013. Conclusion: Although retracted articles constitute the tip of an iceberg, they are still a matter of major concern in the scientific world. So, editors should follow the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) guidelines and make an effective strategy in order to reduce such misconduct, as it reflects very adversely not only in the scientific community but also in the general public.","2015","2019-11-10 17:45:40","2021-06-11 19:57:29","2019-11-10 16:22:11","19","","1","5","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/M3THRUYW/_EPPI-Reviewer Coding Report.pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/BCTHL4K8/Damineni et al. - 2015 - A comprehensive comparative analysis of articles r.pdf","","characteristics of retracted papers - database perspective; EPPI Reviewer Article; RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10; year focus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study analyzed retractions of previously published articles from surgery journals. Methods: We searched for retracted articles in the 100 surgery journals with the highest SJR2 indicator grades. Results: We found 130 retracted articles in 49 journals (49%). Five or more retracted articles were published in 8 journals (8%). The mean time between publication and retraction was 26 months (range 1 to 158 months). The United States, China, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom accounted for more than 3 out of 4 of the retracted articles. The greatest number of retractions came from manuscripts about orthopedics and traumatology, general surgery, anesthesiology, cardiothoracic surgery, and plastic surgery. Nonsurgeons were responsible for 16% of retractions in these surgery journals. The main reasons for retraction were duplicate publication (42%), plagiarism (16%), absence of proven integrity of the study (14%), incorrect data (13%), data published without authorization (12%), violation of research ethics (11%), documented fraud (11%), request of an author(s) (5%), and unknown (3%). In 25% of the retracted articles, other publications by the same authors also had been retracted. Conclusion: Retraction of published articles does not occur frequently in surgery journals. Some form of scientiﬁc misconduct was present in the majority of retractions, especially duplication of publication and plagiarism. Retractions of previously published articles were most frequent from countries with the greatest number of publications; some authors showed recidivism.","2018-06","2019-11-10 17:45:40","2021-06-11 19:57:29","2019-11-10 16:22:00","1201-1206","","6","163","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/L4XIDLIR/_EPPI-Reviewer Coding Report.pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/QK4PKSM3/Cassão et al. - 2018 - Retracted articles in surgery journals.

This analysis was conducted to evaluate manuscript publication timelines following completion of clinical trials in an effort to better understand industry trends. Research design and methods: Clinical trial data from ten top-selling oncology drugs were gathered using ClinicalTrials.gov. Phase 3 interventional studies with completed enrollment and posted results were included–studies for indications unrelated to oncology/hematology were excluded. Corresponding manuscript publication information was gathered–only primary manuscripts linked to the clinical trials were included. Clinical trials and manuscript publication data were recorded and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: A total of 105 clinical trials were identified and analyzed. Of these studies, 55 had publications linked to the trial. There was variation in time between primary completion date and manuscript publication date. Three studies had manuscripts published within 6 months of the primary completion date, 4 had manuscripts within 1 year. Fourteen studies had manuscripts published within the second year after primary completion. The largest portion of manuscripts, 24, was published over 2 years after primary completion. A positive trend was observed between study length and time to publication, number of patients and time to publication. Ten studies had a manuscript published prior to the primary completion date listed. Conclusions: The results suggest that clinical trial information is not fully made available to the general healthcare audience in a timely manner.

Method: A descriptive cross-sectional study was designed including all retracted publications from January 1st, 2013-December 31st, 2016 indexed in PubMed. The causes of retraction were classiﬁed as: data management, authorship issues, plagiarism, unethical research, journal issues, review process, conﬂict of interest, other causes, and unknown reasons. Then, misbehaviour was classiﬁed as misconduct, suspicion of misconduct or no misconduct suspicion. Results: 1,082 retracted publications were identiﬁed. The retraction rate for the period was 2.5 per 10,000 publications. The main cause of retraction was misconduct (65.3%), and the leading reasons were plagiarism, data management and compromise of the review process. The highest proportion of retracted publications corresponded to Iran (15.52 per 10,000), followed by Egypt and China (11.75 and 8.26 per 10,000). Conclusions: Currently, misconduct is the main cause of retraction. Speciﬁc strategies to limit this phenomenon must be implemented. It would be useful to standardize reasons and procedures for retraction. The development of a standard retraction form to be permanently indexed in a database might be relevant. © 2018 SESPAS.

The objective of this study was to determine the frequency and reason for retraction of cancer publications and to determine how journals in the cancer field handle retracted articles. Methods: We searched three online databases (MEDLINE, Embase, The Cochrane Library) from database inception until 2015 for retracted journal publications related to cancer research. For each article, the reason for retraction was categorized as plagiarism, duplicate publication, fraud, error, authorship issues, or ethical issues. Accessibility of the retracted article was defined as intact, removed, or available but with a watermark over each page. Descriptive data was collected on each retracted article including number of citations, journal name and impact factor, study design, and time between publication and retraction. The publications were screened in duplicated and two reviewers extracted and categorized data. Results: Following database search and article screening, we identified 571 retracted cancer publications. The majority (76.4%) of cancer retractions were issued in the most recent decade, with 16.6 and 6.7% of the retractions in the prior two decades respectively. Retractions were issued by journals with impact factors ranging from 0 (discontinued) to 55.8. The average impact factor was 5.4 (median 3.54, IQR 1.8–5.5). On average, a retracted article was cited 45 times (median 18, IQR 6–51), with a range of 0–742. Reasons for retraction include plagiarism (14.4%), fraud (28.4%), duplicate publication (18.2%), error (24.2%), authorship issues (3.9%), and ethical issues (2.1%). The reason for retraction was not stated in 9.8% of cases. Twenty-nine percent of retracted articles remain available online in their original form. Conclusions: Retractions in cancer research are increasing in frequency at a similar rate to all biomedical research retractions. Cancer retractions are largely due to academic misconduct. Consequences to cancer patients, the public at large, and the research community can be substantial and should be addressed with future research. Despite the implications of this important issue, some cancer journals currently fall short of the current guidelines for clearly stating the reason for retraction and identifying the publication as retracted.","2017-12","2019-11-10 17:45:40","2021-06-11 19:57:29","2019-11-10 16:21:45","","","1","2","","","Retractions in cancer research","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/JKAFC2QP/_EPPI-Reviewer Coding Report.pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/DR4DU7VH/Bozzo et al. - 2017 - Retractions in cancer research a systematic surve.pdf","","EPPI Reviewer Article; RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10; systematic reviews of retracted papers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design.—A search of MEDLINE from 1966 through August 1997 for articles that had been retracted. Main Outcome Measures.—Characteristics of retractions and citations to articles after retraction. Results.—A total of 235 articles had been retracted.

This study developed a novel rubric for rating and standardizing the quality of retraction notices, and used it to assess the retraction notices of 171 retracted articles from 15 journals. Results suggest the rubric to be a robust, if preliminary, tool. Analysis of the retraction notices suggest that their quality has not improved over the last 50 years, that it varies both between and within journals, and that it is dependent on the field of science, the author of the retraction notice, and the reason for retraction. These results indicate a lack of uniformity in the retraction policies of individual journals and throughout the scientific literature.

The ﬁrst category, although highly deplorable has almost no effect on the advancement of science, the third category is relatively minor. The papers belonging to the second category are most troublesome from the scientiﬁc point of view, as they are misleading and have serious negative implications not only on science but also on society. In this paper, we explore some temporal characteristics of retracted articles, including time of publication, years to retract, growth of post retraction citations over time and social media attention by the three major categories. The data set comprises 995 retracted articles retrieved in October 2014 from Elsevier’s ScienceDirect. Citations and Mendeley reader counts were retrieved four times within 4 years, which allowed us to examine post-retraction longitudinal trends not only for citations, but also for Mendeley reader counts. The major ﬁndings are that both citation counts and Mendeley reader counts continue to grow after retraction.","2018-09","2019-11-10 17:45:40","2021-06-11 19:57:29","2019-11-10 16:21:39","1771-1783","","3","116","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/6VHJZWHX/_EPPI-Reviewer Coding Report.pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/ETS2PJ54/Bar-Ilan and Halevi - 2018 - Temporal characteristics of retracted articles.pdf","","altmetrics; citation studies; EPPI Reviewer Article; RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

LILACS has a similar geographical coverage and includes dissertations and conference/symposia proceedings, but it is limited to publications in the health sciences. A search for retraction notices was performed in these two databases using the keywords ‘‘retracted’’, ‘‘retraction’’ ‘‘withdrawal’’, ‘‘withdrawn’’, ‘‘removed’’ and ‘‘redress’’. Documents were manually checked to identify those that actually referred to retractions, which were then analyzed and categorized according to the reasons alleged in the notices. Dates of publication/retraction and time to retraction were also recorded. Searching procedures were performed between June and December 2014. Thirty-one retraction notices were identiﬁed, ﬁfteen of which were in JCR-indexed journals. ‘‘Plagiarism’’ was alleged in six retractions of this group. Among the non-JCR journals, retraction reasons were alleged in fourteen cases, twelve of which were attributed to ‘‘plagiarism’’. The proportion of retracted articles for the SciELO database was approximately 0.005 %. The reasons alleged in retraction notices may be used as signposts to inform discussions in Latin America on plagiarism and research integrity. At the international level, these results suggest that the correction of the literature is becoming global and is not limited to mainstream international publications.","2016-10","2019-11-10 17:45:40","2021-06-11 19:57:29","2019-11-10 16:21:21","1447-1456","","5","22","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/QNPPGPSZ/_EPPI-Reviewer Coding Report.pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/562P8VZK/Almeida et al. - 2016 - Plagiarism Allegations Account for Most Retraction.pdf","","characteristics of retracted papers - database perspective; EPPI Reviewer Article; RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10; revisit; systematic reviews of retracted papers; systematic reviews of retracted papers - geographic perspective","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study is a rhetorical examination of these strategies as they are reﬂected in choices in language: it compares the published retractions and letters of apology with the letters that charge misconduct. The letters are examined for any shifts in language between the charge of misconduct and the response to the charge in order to assess whether the apology was sincere or ritualistic. The results indicate that although most authors’ published acknowledgments of scientiﬁc misconduct seem to minimize culpability by means of the strategic use of language, their resulting ritualistic apologies often still satisfy in some way the accusers’ (and thus their community’s) concerns.","2010-03","2019-11-10 17:45:40","2021-06-11 19:57:29","2019-11-10 16:21:15","175-184","","1","16","","","A rhetorical analysis of apologies for scientific misconduct","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/QGH6ND6R/_EPPI-Reviewer Coding Report.pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/LSJYCUKQ/Souder - 2010 - A Rhetorical Analysis of Apologies for Scientific .pdf","","EPPI Reviewer Article; language studies related to retracted papers; retraction notices; RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Indeed, the scientific method itself is intended to overcome mistakes and misdeeds. So, we aimed to assess various factors associated with retraction of scientific articles from 2004 to 2013. Data were retrieved from PubMed and Medline using the keywords retraction of articles, retraction notice, and withdrawal of article in April 2014 to detect articles retracted from 2004 to 2013. Statistical analysis was carried out using t‑test and Karl Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Results showed that a total of 2343 articles were retracted between 2004 and 2013, and original articles followed by case reports constituted major part of it. Time interval between submission and retraction of article has reduced in recent times. Impact factor and retraction do not have any significant correlation. We conclude that although retraction of articles is a rare event, its constant rise in scientific literature is quite worrisome. It is still unclear whether misconduct/mistakes in articles are increasing hastily or the articles are retracted at a rapid rate in recent times. So, it should be considered as an urgent issue and it is the responsibility of journal editors to track misconduct by following Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) guidelines and making an effective strategy.","2014-07","2019-11-10 17:45:40","2021-06-11 19:57:29","2019-11-10 16:21:12","136-139","","3","4","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/VKCNVBTN/_EPPI-Reviewer Coding Report.pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/4SWRMKRK/Singh et al. - 2014 - A Comprehensive Analysis of Articles Retracted Bet.pdf","","characteristics of retracted papers - database perspective; EPPI Reviewer Article; RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10; year focus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is unclear how broadly the issue of misleading and fraudulent publications pertains to retractions of drug therapy studies. Therefore, we sought to determine the trends and factors associated with retracted publications in drug therapy literature. A PubMed search was conducted to identify retracted drug therapy articles published from 2000–2011. Articles were grouped according to reason for retraction, which was classified as scientific misconduct or error. Scientific misconduct was further divided into data fabrication, data falsification, questions of data veracity, unethical author conduct, and plagiarism. Error was defined as duplicate publication, scientific mistake, journal error, or unstated reasons. Additional data were extracted from the retracted articles, including type of article, funding source, author information, therapeutic area, and retraction issue. A total of 742 retractions were identified from 2000–2011 in the general biomedical literature, and 102 drug studies met our inclusion criteria. Of these, 73 articles (72%) were retracted for a reason classified as scientific misconduct, whereas 29 articles (28%) were retracted for error. Among the 73 articles classified as scientific misconduct, those classified as unethical author conduct (32 articles [44%]) and data fabrication (24 articles [33%]) constituted the majority. The median time from publication of the original article to retraction was 31 months (range 1–130). Fifty percent of retracted articles did not state a funding source, whereas pharmaceutical manufacturer funding accounted for only 13 articles (13%) analyzed. Many retractions were due to repeat offenses by a small number of authors, with nearly 40% of the retracted studies associated with two individuals. We found that a greater proportion of drug therapy articles were retracted for reasons of misconduct and fraud compared with other biomedical studies. It is important for health care practitioners to monitor the literature for retractions so that recommendations for drug therapy and patient management may be modified accordingly.","2012-07","2019-11-10 17:45:40","2021-06-11 19:57:29","2019-11-10 16:21:06","586-595","","7","32","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/MFLVWBQG/_EPPI-Reviewer Coding Report.pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/YND569ZH/Samp et al. - 2012 - Retracted Publications in the Drug Literature.pdf","","EPPI Reviewer Article; RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10; systematic reviews of retracted papers; systematic reviews of retracted papers - method/topical beyond field","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of our study was to assess the prevalence, characteristics, and trends of retracted publications in the ﬁeld of orthopaedics. Methods: Five databases were utilized to identify retracted publications in orthopaedics. The cited articles were assessed for various characteristics, including reason for retraction, based on the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) guidelines and trends over time. Results: From 1984 to June 4, 2016, 59 of 229,502 orthopaedic publications were retracted (3 per 10,000 articles). There was a spike in the prevalence (22 of 59) of retracted articles in 2015. When compared with the total number of retracted publications identiﬁed through PubMed, the ﬁeld of orthopaedics represented 1.4% of all retracted publications. The original version of 47 of these 59 retracted publications was still available on the respective journal’s web site; 14 (30%) of these were not noted as having been retracted. The mean time from electronic publication to retraction was 19.4 ± 23.3 months. The mean number of citations of a retracted publication after the date of retraction was 9.3 ± 19.3. Reasons for retraction included plagiarism (32%), misconduct (27%), redundant publication (22%), miscalculation or experimental error (8%), and unethical research (0%); the reason for retraction was not stated for 10% of the publications. There was no correlation between a journal’s impact factor and the mean number of months to retraction (p = 0.564). Conclusions: While uncommon, the retraction of publications within the ﬁeld of orthopaedics may be increasing. The most often cited reasons for retraction were plagiarism, misconduct, and redundant publication.

Results: Newspaper articles addressed exactly three of the 50 retracted publications, and press releases, exactly four of the 50 retracted publications. All three retracted publications that received newspaper coverage also had a press release. In other words, newspapers only covered a retraction that had been introduced by a press release. Conclusion: One would expect that newspaper coverage would increase after a press release, but the suggested relationships among a medical journal article retraction, a press release and newspaper coverage should be further investigated. If the linkage suggested by the data of this study holds, and if newspaper coverage stimulates library patron interest, then a medical library might prepare itself for information requests following a press release.","2007","2019-11-10 17:45:40","2021-06-11 19:57:29","","210–215","","3","24","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/H2HT6G9X/_EPPI-Reviewer Coding Report.pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/S3R2ASXY/Rada - 2007 - Retractions, BlackwellPublishingLtd press releases.pdf","","EPPI Reviewer Article; media research related to retracted papers; RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Within days of the review's publication, scientists identified major coding errors and other methodological problems that invalidated the principal conclusions of the study and led to a retraction. While the original study results and their negative conclusions were widely publicized in the media, the retraction seemed to go unnoticed. Objective: This paper aims to document an unprecedented case of misinformation from a Cochrane review and its impact on media, scientists, and patients. As well, it aims to identify the generic factors leading to the incident and suggest remedies. Methods: This was a qualitative study of the events leading to the retraction of the publication and of the reactions from media, scientists, and patients. This includes a review and content analysis of academic and mass media articles responding to the publication and retraction. Mass media articles were retrieved in May 2005 from LexisNexis Academic and Google and were classified and tallied. The extended case method is employed, and the analysis is also applied to comparable publishing events. Results: A search on LexisNexis Academic database with the query “Elizabeth Murray AND health” for the period of June 2004 to May 2005 revealed a total of 15 press reports, of which only 1 addressed the retraction. Google was searched for references to the review, and the first 200 retrieved hits were analyzed. Of these, 170 pages were not related to the review. Of the remaining 30 pages, 23 (77%) were reports about the original publication that did not mention the retraction, 1 (3%) was a bibliography not mentioning the retraction, and 6 (20%) addressed the retraction, of which only 1 was a non-Cochrane–related source. Conclusions: Analyzed retrievals showed that the mass media gave more coverage to the Cochrane review than to the retraction or to a related systematic review with a similar scope but a different conclusion. Questionable results were prematurely disseminated, oversimplified, and sensationalized, while the retraction was hardly noticed by the public. Open commentary by scientists and patients helped to rapidly identify the errors but did not prevent or correct the dissemination of misinformation.","2005-06-30","2019-11-10 17:45:40","2021-06-11 19:57:29","2019-11-10 16:20:55","e18","","2","7","","","A case study of a retracted systematic review on interactive health communication applications","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/ZJ23SNFN/_EPPI-Reviewer Coding Report.pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/G282RF5I/Rada - 2005 - A Case Study of a Retracted Systematic Review on I.pdf","","EPPI Reviewer Article; media research related to retracted papers; RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One method for such correction is retraction of an article. Anecdotal evidence suggested a lack of consistency in journal policies and practices regarding retraction. In order to develop guidelines, we reviewed retractions in Medline to discover how and why articles were retracted. Methods We retrieved all available Medline retractions from 2005 to 2008 and a one-in-three random selection of those from 1988 to 2004. This yielded 312 retractions (from a total of 870). Details of the retraction including the reason for retraction were recorded by two investigators. Results Medline retractions have increased sharply since 1980 and currently represent 0.02% of included articles. Retractions were issued by authors (63%), editors (21%), journals (6%), publishers (2%) and institutions (1%). Reasons for retraction included honest error or non-replicable ﬁndings (40%), research misconduct (28%), redundant publication (17%) and unstated/unclear (5%). Some of the stated reasons might have been addressed by corrections. Conclusions Journals’ retraction practices are not uniform.

This very often means that the results it reports are flawed. Several authors have voiced concerns about the presence of retracted research in the memory of science. In particular, a retracted result is propagated by citing it. In the published literature, many instances are given of retracted articles that are cited both before and after their retraction. Even worse is the possibility that these articles in turn are cited in such a way that the retracted result is propagated further. Methods: We have conducted a case study to find out how a retracted article is cited and whether retracted results are propagated through indirect citations. We have constructed the entire citation network for this case. Results: We show that directly citing articles is an important source of propagation of retracted research results. In contrast, in our case study, indirect citations do not contribute to the propagation of the retracted result. Conclusions: While admitting the limitations of a study involving a single case, we think there are reasons for the non-contribution of indirect citations that hold beyond our case study.","2016-12","2019-11-10 17:45:40","2021-06-11 19:57:29","2019-11-10 16:20:50","3","","","1","","","Propagation of errors in citation networks","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/K7QCSWV8/_EPPI-Reviewer Coding Report.pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/I2VMHYUZ/van der Vet and Nijveen - 2016 - Propagation of errors in citation networks a stud.pdf","","CCA; citation network studies; citation studies; EPPI Reviewer Article; RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Study Design and Setting: We selected articles retracted due to allegations of falsiﬁcation in January 1, 1980 to March 1, 2006 from journals with impact factor O10 and O30,000 annual citations. We evaluated characteristics of these papers and misconduct-involved authors and assessed whether they correlated with time to retraction. We also compared retracted articles vs. matched nonretracted articles in the same journals. Results: Fourteen eligible journals had 63 eligible retracted articles. Median time from publication to retraction was 28 months; it was 79 months for articles where a senior researcher was implicated in the misconduct vs. 22 months when junior researchers were implicated (log-rank P ! 0.001). For the 25 implicated authors, the median time from the ﬁrst publication of a fraudulent paper to the ﬁrst retraction was 34 months, again with a clear difference according to researcher rank (log-rank P 5 0.001). Retracted articles didn’t differ from matched nonretracted papers in citations received within 12 months, number of authors, country, funding, or ﬁeld, but were twofold more likely to have multinational authorship (P 5 0.049).

The purpose of this study was to characterize trends related to retracted publications within radiology journals. MATERIALS AND METHODS. PubMed was queried to identify all articles with the publication type “retracted publication” or “retraction of publication.” Articles published within radiology journals were identified using Journal Citation Reports’ journal categories. Available versions of original articles and publication notices were accessed from journal websites. Citations to retracted publications were identified using Web of Science. Overall trends were assessed. RESULTS. Forty-eight retracted original research articles were identified within radiology journals since 1983, which included 1.1% of all PubMed “retracted publication” entries. Distinct PubMed entries were available for the retracted publication and retraction notification in 39 of 48 articles. The original PDF was available for 37 articles, although the articles were not watermarked as retracted in 23 cases. In six cases with a watermarked PDF, further searches identified nonwatermarked versions. Original HTML versions were available for 13 articles but 11 were not watermarked. The mean (± SD) delay between publication and retraction was 2.7 ± 2.8 years (range, 0–16 years). The mean number of citations to retracted articles was 10.9 ± 17.1 (range, 0–94 citations). Reasons for retraction included problematic or incorrect methods or results (although it typically was unclear whether these represented honest errors or misconduct) in 33.3% of cases, complete or partial duplicate publication in 33.3% of cases, plagiarism in 14.6% of cases, a permission issue in 8.3% of cases, the publisher’s error in 6.3% of cases, and no identified reason in 6.3% of cases. One or no retractions occurred annually from 1986 to 2001, although two or more retractions occurred annually in nine of the 12 years from 2002 through 2013. CONCLUSION.

Secondary objectives included investigating other factors associated with plagiarism (e.g., national language of the first author’s country affiliation, publication type, journal ranking). Design: Systematic, controlled, retrospective, bibliometric study. Data source: Retracted publications dataset in MEDLINE (search filters: English, human, January 1966–February 2008). Data selection: Retracted misconduct publications were classified according to the first author’s country affiliation, country income level, and country national language, publication type, and ranking of the publishing journal. Standardised definitions and data collection tools were used; data were analysed (odds ratio [OR], 95% confidence limits [CL], chi-squared tests) by an independent academic statistician. Results: Of the 213 retracted misconduct publications, 41.8% (89/213) were retracted for plagiarism, 52.1% (111/ 213) for falsification/fabrication, 2.3% (5/213) for author disputes, 2.3% (5/213) for ethical issues, and 1.4% (3/213) for unknown reasons. The OR (95% CL) of plagiarism retractions (other misconduct retractions as reference) were higher (P50.001) for first authors affiliated with lower-income versus higher-income countries (15.4 [4.5, 52.9]) and with non-English versus English national language countries (3.2 [1.8, 5.7]), for non-original research versus original research publications (8.4 [3.3, 21.3]), for case reports and series versus other original research types (4.2 [1.4, 13.0]), and for publications in low-ranked versus high-ranked journals (4.9 [2.4, 9.9]). Up until 2012, there were significantly (P50.007) fewer ‘serial offenders’ (first authors with 41 retraction) with publications retracted for plagiarism (11.5%, 9/78) than other types of misconduct (28.9%, 24/83). Conclusions: This is the first study to demonstrate that publications retracted for plagiarism are significantly associated with first authors affiliated with lower-income countries. These findings have implications for developing appropriate evidence-based strategies and allocation of resources to help mitigate plagiarism misconduct.","2012-10","2019-11-10 17:45:40","2021-06-11 19:57:29","2019-11-10 16:20:43","1575-1583","","10","28","","","Publication misconduct and plagiarism retractions","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/KUPUIEUX/_EPPI-Reviewer Coding Report.pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/PV32M43A/Stretton et al. - 2012 - Publication misconduct and plagiarism retractions.pdf","","EPPI Reviewer Article; RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10; systematic reviews of retracted papers - reason related","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"BLGAHT5K","journalArticle","2013","Steen, R Grant; Casadevall, Arturo; Fang, Ferric C","Why has the number of scientific retractions increased?","PLOS ONE","","","","","Background: The number of retracted scientific publications has risen sharply, but it is unclear whether this reflects an increase in publication of flawed articles or an increase in the rate at which flawed articles are withdrawn. Methods and Findings: We examined the interval between publication and retraction for 2,047 retracted articles indexed in PubMed. Time-to-retraction (from publication of article to publication of retraction) averaged 32.91 months. Among 714 retracted articles published in or before 2002, retraction required 49.82 months; among 1,333 retracted articles published after 2002, retraction required 23.82 months (p,0.0001). This suggests that journals are retracting papers more quickly than in the past, although recent articles requiring retraction may not have been recognized yet. To test the hypothesis that time-to-retraction is shorter for articles that receive careful scrutiny, time-to-retraction was correlated with journal impact factor (IF). Time-to-retraction was significantly shorter for high-IF journals, but only ,1% of the variance in time-toretraction was explained by increased scrutiny. The first article retracted for plagiarism was published in 1979 and the first for duplicate publication in 1990, showing that articles are now retracted for reasons not cited in the past. The proportional impact of authors with multiple retractions was greater in 1972–1992 than in the current era (p,0.001). From 1972–1992, 46.0% of retracted papers were written by authors with a single retraction; from 1993 to 2012, 63.1% of retracted papers were written by single-retraction authors (p,0.001). Conclusions: The increase in retracted articles appears to reflect changes in the behavior of both authors and institutions. Lower barriers to publication of flawed articles are seen in the increase in number and proportion of retractions by authors with a single retraction. Lower barriers to retraction are apparent in an increase in retraction for ‘‘new’’ offenses such as plagiarism and a decrease in the time-to-retraction of flawed work.","2013","2019-11-10 17:45:40","2021-06-11 19:57:29","","9","","7","8","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/97GVH95N/_EPPI-Reviewer Coding Report.pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/XEQWJA29/Steen et al. - 2013 - Why Has the Number of Scientific Retractions Incre.pdf","","EPPI Reviewer Article; rate of retraction; RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this cross-sectional bibliographic analysis of the scholarly publications that cited a 1998 article by Wakefield et al, cited references were collected from a Web of Science Core Collection search performed on March 11, 2019. A total of 1211 articles were identified, with 58 citing works excluded because they were non–English-language publications or the citation to the study by Wakefield et al could not be located by reviewers. Citing works consisted of books, research articles, letters, editorials, news items, and other scholarly literature. Citations to the article by Wakefield et al were identified and analyzed by 2 reviewers in a blinded screening. Reviewers assigned a characteristic to each citation and indicated whether the retraction was documented. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The characteristics of citations to the article by Wakefield et al, were categorized as negative, affirmative, or contrastive; if not, persuasive; and if not, assumptive, perfunctory, methodologic, or conceptual. Whether the partial retraction or notice of retraction was included in the citing work was also documented. RESULTS Among the 1153 citing works included in this analysis, the most common citation characteristics were negative (838 [72.7%]) followed by perfunctory (106 [9.2%]) and affirmative (94 [8.2%]). A total of 123 of 322 citing works (38.2%) published between 2005 and 2010 documented the partial retraction. After the notice of retraction was published in 2010, the percentage of citing works that documented the partial retraction and/or notice of retraction between 2011 and 2018 increased to 360 of 502 (71.7%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Since the article by Wakefield et al was initially published, authors have mostly negated the findings of the study. A significant number of authors did not document retractions of the article by Wakefield et al. The findings suggest that improvements are needed from publishers, bibliographic databases, and citation management software to ensure that retracted articles are accurately documented.","2019-11-15","2019-11-17 22:26:35","2021-06-11 19:57:29","2019-11-17 22:26:35","e1915552","","11","2","","JAMA Netw Open","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/7QS8AA6K/Suelzer et al. - 2019 - Assessment of citations of the retracted article b.pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/ZS4MHMVF/suelzer_2019_oi_190588.pdf","","citation studies; RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

La base de datos Retraction Watch (RW) es la que contiene más artículos retractados a nivel mundial. El objetivo fue conocer las razones y características de los artículos retractados de biomedicina de autores españoles. Material y métodos Se realizó una búsqueda en la base de datos RW de 7 tipos de artículos científicos de 9 disciplinas de biomedicina —biología, genética, medicina, microbiología, neurociencias, nutrición, odontología, salud pública y toxicología—, con al menos un autor que trabajase en un centro español, publicados en 1970-2018. Se registraron las características de los artículos y las razones de su retractación. Resultados De los 18.621 artículos retractados, 217 (1%) lo eran de españoles; 155 (74%) eran de biomedicina y de los tipos de artículos de interés. En la mayoría, hubo varias razones para retractar el artículo. La mala práctica en la investigación (fabricación, falsificación, plagio) y la duplicación estaban involucradas en el 25% y el 35% de los casos, respectivamente. Solo el 22% de los artículos se retractaron por errores de los autores o de las revistas. Un odontólogo retractó 18 artículos —todos de la misma revista y en el mismo año, 2018—, lo que supone el 12% de todos los artículos retractados de biomedicina. Conclusión El número de artículos retractados de autores españoles en biomedicina es bajo. La mala práctica científica es una razón frecuentemente involucrada, con un porcentaje similar de artículos retractados por errores involuntarios. Background and objective To analyse articles retracted due to irregularities by authors helps to determine the state of scientific integrity of a discipline or country. The Retraction Watch (RW) database is the largest worldwide database on retracted articles. The objective was to determine the reasons for and features of retracted biomedical articles by Spanish authors. Material and methods A search was conducted in the RW database of 7 types of scientific articles from 9 biomedicine disciplines −biology, genetics, medicine, microbiology, neurosciences, nutrition, dentistry, public health and toxicology−, with at least one author working in a Spanish centre, and published between 1970 and 2018. The features of the articles and the reasons for their retraction were recorded. Results Of the 18,621 retracted articles, 217 (1%) were by Spanish authors; 155 (74%) were on biomedicine and the types of articles of interest. In most cases, there were several reasons for retracting an article. Research misconduct (fabrication, falsification, plagiarism) and duplication were involved in 25% and 35% of the cases, respectively. Twenty-two percent of the articles were retracted due to errors by the authors or the journals. A dentist retracted 18 articles −all from the same journal and in the same year, 2018−, which accounts for 12% of all retracted biomedicine articles.

This paper, based on a random sample of 2,046 retracted papers, which were published between 1975 and 2019, extracted from Retraction Watch and the websites of major publishers, shows that 53% of the retraction notices do not specify who initiated the retraction. Nearly 10% of the retraction notes either omit or do not contain information related to reasons for retractions. Furthermore, most of the retracted papers in our sample have no limitation section; those who do are commonly unhelpful or irrelevant. The results carry three implications for scientific transparency: retraction notices need to be more informative; limitation sections ought to be a required and even an open section of all published articles; and finally, promoting ‘heroic acts’ in science can positively change the current publishing culture.","2020","2019-12-31 22:25:18","2021-06-11 19:57:29","2019-12-31 22:25:18","119-130","","2","33","","","The limitations of retraction notices and the heroic acts of authors who correct the scholarly record","","","","","","","en","© 2019 The Author(s).

Method:               Papers in which the first author was affiliated to an Arabian country were selected from the Retraction Watch database covering the period 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2018. The retrieved records were divided into nine categories based on the reasons for retraction.                                         Results:               The search yielded 322 retractions, and the most frequent reason for retraction was plagiarism (34.5%). The median time from publication to retraction was 14 (25%-75% percentile 5-30) months. The number of papers retracted each year as well as the number of papers published in a given year but subsequently retracted increased steadily over the 21 years. The proportion of retracted papers to the total number of published papers (0.17%) was higher than the global proportion and was the highest for Algeria (1%) and the lowest for Lebanon (0.03%). Of the countries within the Arab region, 12 out of 14 countries showed either plagiarism or duplication as the most common reason for retraction; however, the countries differed in terms of the number of retractions and the time from publishing to retraction.                                         Conclusion:               Plagiarism was the most common cause of retraction in the Arab countries. The increase in the number of papers retracted each year was probably because searches now extend farther in the past, whereas the increase in the number of papers published in a given year but subsequently retracted can be attributed to the overall increase in the number of papers published.","2020-02-18","2020-03-24 21:04:39","2021-06-11 19:57:29","2020-03-24 21:04:39","e51002","","","46","","ESE","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/QC67CD8T/Aldeen AlRyalat et al. - 2020 - Retractions of research papers by authors from the.pdf","","RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For instance, retractions help scientific enterprise perform its self-correcting function and provide lessons for future researchers; furthermore, they represent the fulfillment of social responsibilities, and they enable scientific communities to offer better monitoring services to keep problematic studies in check. This study aims to provide a thorough overview of the practice of retraction in scientific publishing from the first incident to the present.Methods: We built a database using SQL Server 2016 and homemade artificial intelligence tools to extract and classify data sources including RetractionWatch, official publishers’ archives, and online communities into ready-to-analyze groups and to scan them for new data. After data cleaning, a dataset of 18,603 retractions from 1,753 (when the first retracted paper was published) to February 2019, covering 127 research fields, was established.Results: Notable retraction events include the rise in retracted articles starting in 1999 and the unusual number of retractions in 2010. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Elsevier, and Springer account for nearly 60% of all retracted papers globally, with Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers contributing the most retractions, even though it is not the organization that publishes the most journals. Finally, reasons for retraction are diverse but the most common is “fake peer review”.Conclusion: This study suggests that the frequency of retraction has boomed in the past 20 years, and it underscores the importance of understanding and learning from the practice of retracting scientific articles.","2020-02-20","2020-03-24 21:05:25","2021-06-11 19:57:29","2020-03-24 21:05:25","34-44","","1","7","","Sci Ed","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/TQJ8EW4G/Vuong et al. - 2020 - Characteristics of retracted articles based on ret.pdf","","RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Material and methods This review has been recorded in the PROSPERO database (CRD42017075634). Two independent reviewers performed an electronic search (Pubmed, Retraction Watch) for retracted articles in dental literature up to December 31, 2018. Results 180 retracted papers were identified, the first published in 2001. Retractions increased by 47% in the last four-year period (2014–2018), when compared with 2009–2013 (94 and 64 retracted publications, respectively). Author misconduct was the most common reason for retraction (65.0%), followed by honest scientific errors (12.2%) and publisher-related issues (10.6%). The majority of retracted research was conducted in Asia (55.6%), with 49 papers written in India (27.2%). 552 researchers (89%) are listed as authors in only one retracted article, while 10 researchers (1.6%) are present in five or more retracted publications. Retracted articles were cited 530 times after retraction: the great majority of these citations (89.6%) did not consider the existence of the retraction notice and treated data from retracted articles as reliable. Conclusions Retractions in dental literature have constantly increased in recent years, with the majority of them due to misconduct and fraud. The publication of unreliable research has many negative consequences. Studies derived from such material are designed on potentially incorrect bases, waste funds and resources, and most importantly, increase risk of incorrect treatment for patients.

Design Retrospective review of the PubMed database. Setting N/A. Population Obstetrics and gynaecology articles published from indexation until June 2018. Methods Articles were identified using keywords for retracted articles in obstetrics and gynaecology. Descriptive statistics were performed. Main outcome measures Incidence of article retraction, the reasons given for retraction, and article demographics. Results A total of 176 articles were identified with a median time to retraction of 2 years; over three-quarters were retracted within the last decade (n = 136; 77.3%). The median journal impact factor was 2.5 (range of 0.26-52.67). Subspecialties with the highest number of retractions were gynaecological oncology (n = 76; 43.2%), gynaecology (n = 36; 20.5%), and obstetrics (n = 31; 17.6%). Among 176 first authors, 18 authors (10.2%) had two or more retracted articles. Clinical research articles accounted for approximately one-half of the retracted articles (n = 87; 49.4%). Among the clinical studies, 10.2% (n = 18) were randomised control trials, 16.5% (n = 29) were prospective trials and 13.1% (n = 23) were retrospective studies. Plagiarism (n = 40; 22.7%) and data falsification (n = 37; 21.0%) were the most common reasons given for retraction. Conclusion Article retraction within the obstetrics and gynaecology literature is increasing. The most frequently cited reasons for article retractions were plagiarism, errors in data, fabricated results, article duplication, and compromised peer review. Consequences of article retractions to patient care and the scientific community can be significant. The thorough screening of manuscripts prior to publication should be prioritised.

However, these articles continue to be cited at relatively high rates. The objectives of this paper are: (1) to track the retraction process of these papers, (2) to assess the impact of retraction on subsequent citation rates of these papers, and (3) to compare the citation history of these retracted articles and five other high-profile retraction cases. For Objective #1, all 5 articles to be Retracted were retracted and of the 4 to be Corrected, 2 were Retracted and 2 were Corrected. Eight PubMed and journal sites were identified where retraction messages could be conveyed; the number of retraction messages averaged 3.4+2.5 for these 9 articles. For Objective #2, an absolute ""cleansing"" did not occur. While it initially appears there was a relative ""cleansing"", as citation rates for these articles did decrease after retraction, the reductions in citation rates for these articles (-28%) were the same as those for matched non-retracted publications both by the same author (-28%) and by another investigator (-29%) over the same time frame. Relative to Objective #3, the results for this case are quite different from the 5 other cases assessing this issue, perhaps because of this investigator's ""citation inertia"" as a result of the small percentage of hisr papers that were retracted and the large number of citations to the articles prior to their retraction and to all of his published articles.","2020-04-02","2020-04-05 16:58:11","2021-06-11 19:57:29","2020-04-05 16:58:11","japplphysiol.00003.2020","","","","","Journal of Applied Physiology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/27MDDHSS/Hagberg - 2020 - The Unfortunately Long Life of Some Retracted Biom.pdf","","RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the PubMed and SCOPUS, 227 and 114 titles were found, respectively, from which 34 duplicate titles were removed. An additional 261 titles which did not include “retracted” or “withdrawn” were removed, leaving 46 papers and 6 mined papers were added. The 52 full texts (42 “retracted” and 10 “withdrawn”) were analyzed.         The most frequent reason for retraction or withdrawal was duplication (17, 32.7%) followed by the author's request (9, 17.3%), plagiarism (7, 13.5%), and lack of permission (5, 9.6%). Retraction was most common in Plast Reconstr Surg (6, 12%) followed by Aesthetic Plast Surg (4, 7.9%), Ann Plast Surg (2, 3.9%), J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg (2, 3.9%), and Surg Res (2, 3.9%). Most authors retracted a paper just once; however, 6 authors retracted a paper twice or more. The first retraction was found in 1991, and the number of retractions showed a tendency to increase over time. However, the duplication rate did not change over time (R2 = 0.178, P = 0.117).         Journal reviewers, as well as production editors, should check for duplication, plagiarism, or permission-related problems.","2018-07","2021-02-19 23:42:00","2021-06-11 19:57:29","2021-02-19 23:41:55","1114–1116","","5","29","","","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","journals-lww-com.proxy2.library.illinois.edu","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/ZH93V97G/Retracted_or_Withdrawn_Publications_in_Journals.5.html","","RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One particularly interesting indicator of these standards is the response to mistakes in the control system.","1999","2021-03-09 02:23:17","2021-06-11 20:11:25","","21-22","","","","","","","","","","","Springer","Utrecht","","","","","","","","Publication location: Dordrech","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/87KRCHJV/Rabow and Rabow - 1999 - Retraction of articles Peer-review and quality co.pdf","","RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","European Conference of Medical and Health Libraries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article aims to demonstrate that retractions have gradually increased, especially in the medical field. Methodologically, it is a literature review article whose statistical data were obtained from studies on retraction articles published in English between 2012 to 2017 in the PubMed and Google Scholar databases. Some of the most frequent causes of retraction found were plagiarism, misconduct, errors, fabrication and duplication. The highest incidence rate was reported in the United States, India, China, Japan and Germany. The highest retraction rate was for low-impact journals. The time for retraction is long but has decreased, which allows these articles to be cited and bad science to arise. It is concluded that uniformity is needed in notes and rules of retraction, retracted articles should be marked appropriately, and time for retraction must be reduced. In relation to bioethics, there is a serious problem in the integrity of scientific literature and a possible impact of retractions on the health of people.","2018","2019-11-07 14:33:47","2021-06-11 20:23:37","","100-125","","2","18","","","","","","","","","","es","","","","","","","DOI error, reported 2021-06-11","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/F3ANEIX3/_EPPI-Reviewer Coding Report.pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/48TXY2G6/Torres and Michel - 2018 - Retratação de artigos médicos e suas implicações é.pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/W5TDLGDD/torres translated.pdf","","RetractionReviewBib-v1-2020-10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
