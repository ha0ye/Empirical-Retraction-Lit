  "Abstract": "Retraction of scholarly publications ensures that unqualified knowledge is purged from the scientific community. However, there appears to be little understanding about how this is practiced among library and information science (LIS) journals. Hence, this study investigated the correction and retraction practices of LIS journals. Journals included in the Web of Science's information science and library science subject category were selected for the study and the characteristics of the articles corrected or retracted in those journals between 1996 and 2016 were examined. Findings show that there were 517 corrections and five retractions in LIS journals during the period. Most of the corrections made to articles in LIS journals were minor while the reasons for article retraction included plagiarism, duplication, irreproducible results and methodological errors. Our findings also reveal that on average it took about 587 days for an article to be retracted while some of the retracted articles continued to be cited after retraction. The study concluded that the average number of errors per correction was lower than what had been observed in medical journals while some of the retracted articles continued to receive positive post-retraction citations. It also recommended the inclusion of a check on the validity of literature cited by authors at the review stage as part of the quality control mechanism by publishers of LIS journals.",

Post-retraction citations were classified accord-\ning to: the kind of citing publication (original research,\nreview article, letter/news), the place in the citing article\n(introduction/literature review, methods, results, discussion,\nconclusion), whether the citing article acknowledged the\nretraction, whether the citing article explicitly cited the\nretracted article as presenting valid research, or whether the\nciting article implicitly cited the retracted article as valid.[¬e]\"",

  "Abstract": "Background: Rates of manuscript retraction in academic journals are increasing. Papers are retracted because of scientific misconduct or serious error. To date there have been no studies that have examined rates of retraction in nursing and midwifery journals. Design: A systematic review of Journal Citation Report listed nursing science journals. Data sources: The Medline database was searched systematically from January 1980 through July 2017, and www.retractionwatch.com was manually searched for relevant studies that met the inclusion criteria. Review methods: Two researchers undertook title and abstract and full text screening. Data were extracted on the country of the corresponding author, journal title, impact factor, study design, year of retraction, number of citations after retraction, and reason for retraction. Journals retraction index was also calculated. Results: Twenty-nine retracted papers published in nursing science journals were identified, the first in 2007. This represents 0.029% of all papers published in these journals since 2007. We observed a significant increase in the retraction rate of 0.44 per 10,000 publications per year (95% CI; 0.03–0.84, p =.037). There was a negative association between a journal's retraction index and impact factor with a significant reduction in retraction index of −0.57 for a one-point increase in impact factor (95% CI; −1.05 to −0.09, p =.022). Duplicate publication was the most common reason for retraction (n = 18, 58%). The mean number of citations manuscripts received after retraction was seven, the highest was 52. Most (n = 27, 93.1%) of the retracted papers are still available online (with a watermark indicating they are retracted). Conclusion: Compared to more established academic disciplines, rates of retraction in nursing and midwifery are low. Findings suggest that unsound research is not being identified and that the checks and balances incumbent in the scientific method are not working. In a clinical discipline, this is concerning and may indicate that research that should have been removed from the evidence base continues to influence nursing and midwifery care. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

  "Abstract": "This paper intends to review the reasons for the retraction over the last decade. The paper particularly aims at reviewing these reasons with reference to computer science field to assist authors in comprehending the style of writing. To do that, a total of 36 retracted papers found on the Web of Science within Jan 2007 through July 2017 are explored. Given the retraction notices which are based on 10 common reasons, this paper classifies the two main categories, namely, random and non-random retraction. Retraction due to the duplication of publications scored the highest proportion of all other reasons reviewed. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",

  "Abstract": "This study focuses on retraction notices from two major Latin American/Caribbean indexing databases: SciELO and LILACS. SciELO includes open scientific journals published mostly in Latin America/the Caribbean, from which 10 % are also indexed by Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge Journal of Citation Reports (JCR). LILACS has a similar geographical coverage and includes dissertations and conference/symposia proceedings, but it is limited to publications in the health sciences. A search for retraction notices was performed in these two databases using the keywords \"retracted\", \"retraction\" \"withdrawal\", \"withdrawn\", \"removed\" and \"redress\". Documents were manually checked to identify those that actually referred to retractions, which were then analyzed and categorized according to the reasons alleged in the notices. Dates of publication/retraction and time to retraction were also recorded. Searching procedures were performed between June and December 2014. Thirty-one retraction notices were identified, fifteen of which were in JCR-indexed journals. \"Plagiarism\" was alleged in six retractions of this group. Among the non-JCR journals, retraction reasons were alleged in fourteen cases, twelve of which were attributed to \"plagiarism\". The proportion of retracted articles for the SciELO database was approximately 0.005 %. The reasons alleged in retraction notices may be used as signposts to inform discussions in Latin America on plagiarism and research integrity. At the international level, these results suggest that the correction of the literature is becoming global and is not limited to mainstream international publications.",

This question is especially relevant, considering that retraction policies are still evolving for many of these journals, and retracting papers is not a well-established practice among their editors.\"\n\"Another point worth highlighting is that the results show that vagueness, commonly attributed to retraction notices in the literature (Wager and Williams 2011; Fang et al. 2012), was not prevalent. As we have shown, some of the notices included either lengthy or ÔÔto the pointÕÕ explanations. Not only were most alleged reasons identiÞed, but, as mentioned, some notices included detailed considerations either on the nature of plagiarism or on the reasons leading to the retraction. As most of the notices come from Brazil, including those on plagiarism, detailed (instead of vague) wording may reßect growing attention from the Brazilian academia and funding agencies to plagiarism and self-plagiarism. Note that in one of the major guidelines on research integrity in Brazil, the Directives for Research Integrity from the Brazilian National Research Council for ScientiÞc and Technological Devel- opment (CNPq 2011), plagiarism, self-plagiarism and responsible authorship make up the bulk of the document. This feature is remarkable for the approach to research integrity and publication ethics in the country. Although we may not necessarily infer that this is a reasonable explanation for the peculiar wording in these retractions, these wording patterns can shed some light into our interpretation. Thus, despite the fact that this is not the case for all retractions identiÞed, this feature merits further attention and will add to future studies on the nature and drives for retractions among authors.[¬e]\"",

  "Abstract": "Objective: To provide an overview of retractions of research papers contributed by authors from the Arab region. Method: Papers in which the first author was affiliated to an Arabian country were selected from the Retraction Watch database covering the period 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2018. The retrieved records were divided into nine categories based on the reasons for retraction. Results: The search yielded 322 retractions, and the most frequent reason for retraction was plagiarism (34.5%). The median time from publication to retraction was 14 (25%-75% percentile 5-30) months. The number of papers retracted each year as well as the number of papers published in a given year but subsequently retracted increased steadily over the 21 years. The proportion of retracted papers to the total number of published papers (0.17%) was higher than the global proportion and was the highest for Algeria (1%) and the lowest for Lebanon (0.03%). Of the countries within the Arab region, 12 out of 14 countries showed either plagiarism or duplication as the most common reason for retraction; however, the countries differed in terms of the number of retractions and the time from publishing to retraction. Conclusion: Plagiarism was the most common cause of retraction in the Arab countries. The increase in the number of papers retracted each year was probably because searches now extend farther in the past, whereas the increase in the number of papers published in a given year but subsequently retracted can be attributed to the overall increase in the number of papers published. © 2020, European Association of Science Editors.

  "Abstract": "This study explored national differences in plagiarism and duplicate publication in retracted biomedical literature. The national affiliations of authors and reasons for retraction of papers accessible through PubMed that were published from 2008 to 2012 and subsequently retracted were determined in order to identify countries with the largest numbers and highest rates of retraction due to plagiarism and duplicate publication. Authors from more than fifty countries retracted papers. While the United States retracted the most papers, China retracted the most papers for plagiarism and duplicate publication. Rates of plagiarism and duplicate publication were highest in Italy and Finland, respectively. Unethical publishing practices cut across nations.",

  "Abstract": "Retracted publications are a crucial, yet overlooked, issue in the scientific community. The purpose of this study was to analyze the prevalence, characteristics and reasons of Malaysian retracted papers. The Web of Science and Scopus databases were queried to identify Malaysian retracted publications. Available versions of original articles and publication notices were accessed from journal websites. The publications were assessed for various characteristics, including reason for retraction, based on the Committee on Publication Ethics guidelines, and the authority calling for the retractions. From 2009 to June 2017, 125 Malaysian publications comprising (33 journal articles and 92 conference papers) were retracted. There was a spike in the prevalence of retracted articles in 2010 and 2012 with 42 articles (33.6%) and 41 articles (32.8%) respectively from the 125 retracted articles. The mean time from electronic publication to retraction was 1 year. There is no significant relationship between a journal quartile and the mean number of months to retraction (P = 0.842). The reason for retraction for conference papers was specified as “violation of publication principle”. Journal articles were retracted mainly for duplicate publication, plagiarism, compromised peer review process, and self-plagiarism. Most retracted articles do not contain flawed data; and only 2 retracted articles have been accused of scientific mistakes. The study concludes that retractions were mostly due to the authors misconduct. Despite the increases, the proportion of published scholarly literature affected by retraction remains very small, indicating that retraction represents an uncommon, yet potentially increasing and incipient, issue within Malaysian papers, which publishers as well as editors may have consistently and sufficiently addressed. © 2018, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",

A total of 7 articles published in 20142016 were retracted in the current year (2017). For the past three recent years (2015, 2016, 2017) the frequency of retractions increased. Due to the time-lag between publication and retraction, only seven retractions were identi\u001eed in 2017 at the time of the literature search.

Editors, publishers or funding agencies can decide to retract a paper, but the usual policy is that the authors themselves must retract (Editorial 2003). Only in extreme circumstances would an editor retract a paper without the agreement of the authors, although it is very rare that authors will voluntarily retract as re\u001fected from this study. Authors are reluctant to voluntarily withdraw their material, even if the error is merely due to an honest mistake (van Noorden 2011).[¬e]\"",

  "Abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose is to review the issue of retraction in the scientific literature and to examine the policies on retraction of major biomedical journals. METHOD: The historical background of this issue was investigated through a literature search. The Instructions to Authors of 122 major biomedical journals were reviewed for evidence of a policy on the retraction of articles. Editors of those journals with no mention of retraction in their Instructions to Authors were contacted by email and/or postal mail. RESULTS: Sixty-two percent of the journals investigated did not post or report having a policy on issuing retractions. Only twenty-one (18%) did. The remainder did not post any policy and did not respond to inquiries. DISCUSSION: Including policies in Instructions to Authors relating to the principled conduct of research and publication will improve the ethical environment in which the scientific community works.",

  "Abstract": "In the management academic research, academic advancement, job security, and the securing of research funds at one's university are judged mainly by one's output of publications in high impact journals. With bogus resumes filled with published journal articles, universities and other allied institutions are keen to recruit or sustain the appointment of such academics. This often places undue pressure on aspiring academics and on those already recruited to engage in research misconduct which often leads to research integrity. This structured review focuses on the ethics and integrity of management research through an analysis of retracted articles published from 2005 to 2016. The study employs a structured literature review methodology whereby retracted articles published between 2005 and 2016 in the field of management science were found using Crossref and Google Scholar. The searched articles were then streamlined by selecting articles based on their relevance and content in accordance with the inclusion criteria. Based on the analysed retracted articles, the study shows evidence of ethical misconduct among researchers of management science. Such misconduct includes data falsification, the duplication of submitted articles, plagiarism, data irregularity and incomplete citation practices. Interestingly, the analysed results indicate that the field of knowledge management includes the highest number of retracted articles, with plagiarism constituting the most significant ethical issue. Furthermore, the findings of this study show that ethical misconduct is not restricted to a particular geographic location; it occurs in numerous countries. In turn, avenues of further study on research misconduct in management research are proposed.",

  "Abstract": "To what extent does false science affect the rate and direction of scientific change? We examine the impact of over 1,100 scientific retractions on the citation trajectories of articles that are related to retracted papers in intellectual space but were published prior to the retraction event. Following retraction and relative to carefully selected controls, related articles experience a lasting 5% to 10% decline in the rate of citations received. This penalty is more severe when the retracted article involves fraud or misconduct rather than honest mistakes. In addition, we find that the arrival rate of new articles and funding flows into these fields decrease after a retraction.",

To meet the \u001erst chal- lenge, we have developed a detailed taxonomy of retracted articles to capture the differences in the meaning of the retraction events for follow-on researchers, as described in section II of the online appendix. In a second step and taking inspiration from Newtons aphorism, we then systematically assigned the 1,104 retractions in our sample to three mutu- ally exclusive buckets, denoted strong shoulders, shaky shoulders, and absent shoulders, respectively:  Strong shoulders means that the retraction does not in any way degrade the validity of the papers analysis or claims. This may happen in when a publisher mistakenly printed an article twice, authors published an ostensi- bly valid study without securing approval to publish the (unchallenged) data, or an institutional dispute over the ownership of research materials arose.  Shaky shoulders means that the validity of claims is uncertain or that a fraction of the results is invalid. The typical use of this category concerns instances where results could not be replicated, among other reasons.  Absent shoulders is the appropriate code for retractions associated with fraudulent results, as well as in cases where a mistake in experimental procedure irretrievably invalidates the papers results. In addition, we differentiate between retractions for which the authors intentionally attempted to subvert the scienti\u001ec truth and those for which the article needed to be retracted because of an honest mistake with no indication of foul play. We therefore examined retractions to develop a code for dif- ferent levels of intentional deception.5 We use no sign of intentional deception to code cases where the authors did not intend to deceive, such as instances of miscommunication, contamination of research materials, or coding error. Uncer- tain intent applies where fraud is not \u001ermly established, but negligence or unsubstantiated claims raise questions about the authors motives. The intentional deception code is reserved for cases where falsi\u001ecation, misconduct, or willful acts of plagiarism and self-plagiarism appear to have occurred and were veri\u001eed by author admissions or independent reviews of misconduct.[¬e]\"",

The strong shoulders subsample comprises 202 articles retracted for typically innocuous reasons, or at least reasons that do not cast doubt on the veracity of the results contained in them. The shaky shoulders subsample comprises 289 retracted articles for which either the retraction notice or information retrievable on the Web cast some doubt on the extent the results should be built on by follow-on researchers. Finally, the absent shoulders subsample contains 589 retracted articles that are the source sample for the bulk of the analysis. For these cases, we could ascertain with substantial certainty that the results are not to be relied on for future research. This can occur because of intentional misconduct on the part of the researchers involved or because of mistakes on their part. The comprehensive spreadsheet listing of these retracted articles, complete with the references used to code retraction reasons, can be downloaded at http://jkrieger.scripts.mit.edu/retractions/.\"\n\"As detailed in section II of the online appendix, we develop an exhaustive category scheme to code the reasons that explain the retraction event.

          "Text": "Page 7:\n[¬s]\"Retraction Reasons: 1. Fake Data. This reason matches with an intuitive de nition of scienti c fraud. These cases may include the manipulation and misrepresentation of measurements and calculations, as well as the complete fabrication of patients, samples and results. Oftentimes, these retractions will involve an author admitting wrongdoing, or an institutional investigation concluding that the author(s) engaged in falsi cation of records or results. The existence of an investigation alone does not satisfy the criteria of the \\Fake Data\" reason code, since it is substantive conclusions of an investigation that distinguish these cases from the cases for which \\Questions about Validity\" is the more appropriate code (see below). The default \\shoulders\" code is Absent Shoulders unless the notice or other sources explicitly communicate that falsi cation only concerns minor results in the paper. The default \\intent\" code is Intentional Deception as intent distinguishes this reason from the \\Error/Mistake\" category. 2. Error/Mistake. This reason applies where an inaccuracy of claims is central to the retraction notice or case, but there is no evidence of intentional deception or falsi cation. Contaminated reagents, erroneous interpretations of experimental results, and mislabeled gures are common explanations for the \\Error/Mistake\" coding. Vague retraction notices that cite \\irregularities\" and \\inaccuracies\" in the paper also fall into this category unless we have further evidence linking the authors to suspicion of misconduct. The \\shoulders\" coding is highly dependent on the context of the error. If the error impacts the main ndings of the paper (as is the case when samples or reagents are contaminated), then we assign the Absent Shoulders code. If the error/mistake only pertains to a minor nding, or if the notice maintains support for the key conclusions, then we use Shaky Shoulders code. Strong Shoulders is only appropriate when the mistake clearly has no impact on the veracity of the claims (see #15354845, a letter in which the author refers to the \\NSW Companion Animal Registry\" rather than the proper name of \\Central Animal Records\"). The appropriate \\intent\" code is usually No Sign of Intentional Deception, unless the retraction notice explicitly refers to gross negligence (#12949529) or an especially suspicious explanation is given for the error (as in the case where researchers administered primates methamphetamine instead of MDMA | #17176514, #12970544). 3. Could Not Replicate. A common explanation in retracting notices is that the authors (or other researchers) were unable to reproduce the ndings of the retracted paper. Some of these notices are vague and give no further insight into the reproducibility issues (#8704228), while others o er vague conjectures regarding the source of the problem without identifying its root cause (#8999116). The \\shoulders\" coding defaults to Shaky Shoulders because of the uncertainty surrounding the validity of the original ndings. These cases sometimes warrant a Absent Shoulders classi cation if the original results are clearly incorrect and central to the paper's claims, even if the authors have not identi ed the source of the problem. No Sign of Intentional Deception is the standard code for \\Could Not Replicate\" retractions. Exceptions might result in the Uncertain Intent code when a single author is conspicuously left o the retraction notice (#9508700), or the lack or reproducibility seems linked to the work of a single author (#1364942). 4. Plagiarism. Plagiarism cases are usually easy to spot in retraction notices. Copying or closely imitating text, or using someone else's gures or images without assigning the appropriate credit are typical examples. In some cases, the notice may not explicitly accuse the authors of plagiarism, but will highlight that \\copyright infringement\" (#19021584) or \\close resemblance\" with another paper is the reason for retraction. Strong Shoulders characterizes most retractions in this category because the o ense is copying rather than mistake or falsi cation. However, Shaky Shoulders may be appropriate when the results section of the paper contains plagiarized content, calling into question the accuracy of the claims (#19264925). Intentionality is usually assumed, though cases of carelessness (#11023382), language issues (#14667944), or miscommunication may warrant an Uncertain Intent designation. 5. Fake Data & Plagiarism. This category covers cases where fraud involved both fake data and plagiarism, as independently de ned above. These cases will likely involve an investigation that nds vii[¬e]\"",

If a retraction meets the criteria of \\Fake Data & Plagiarism\" then Absent Shoulders and Intentional Deception are the logical complementary codes. 6. Duplication. The important criterion for \\Duplication\" is that the authors copied from themselves. Most of the articles in this category already appeared in another journal before the second journal realized that the entire article is an exact duplicate or virtually identical to an article by the same au- thors in a di erent journal (#12589830). Some of the \\Duplication\" cases are not entirely republished articles, but will reproduce important content, such as data, charts and conclusions (#15580694). As with plagiarism cases, these cases are assigned the Strong Shoulders code by default, but may fall into the Shaky Shoulders bucket when meaningful di erences exist between the duplicated article and its original version (#1930642). The \\intent\" coding follows a similar logic, with Intentional Deception being the primary classi cation. Yet, Uncertain Intent sometimes is the more logical choice when duplication resulted from an apparent miscommunication (#17047133, #16683328). 7. Questions about Validity. This category captures retraction cases associated with vague mis- conduct allegations (#118049464), suspicious \\irregularities\" (#118560433), and \\questionable\" data (#118951275). The hallmark of these retraction notices is that they obfuscate the nature of the misconduct. The vague nature of this category's notices makes Shaky Shoulders and Uncertain Intent the frequent choice for complementary codes. 8. Author Dispute. These cases involve disagreements between authors about content, credit, and permission. Often, these di erent types of disputes will be combined (#14723797, #19727599). Paper submission without the consent of coauthors is the most common underlying reason for this code. Unless warranted by information gained through sleuthing, Shaky Shoulders is the appropriate code for \\Author Dispute\" cases | most disputes stem from con icts surrounding credit attribution and the veri cation of results, rather than outright fraud. Intentional Deception is the prevalent intent code in \\Author Dispute\" cases, though exceptions do exist (#17081259; #16003050). 9. Lack of Consent/IRB Approval. This category includes cases where the authors did not get IRB approval or did not secure patient informed consent before conducting their study. Ambiguous cases of \\ethics violations\" (#19819378, #18774408) also fall into the \\Lack of Consent/IRB Approval\" category. The default \\shoulders\" code is Shaky Shoulders. Strong Shoulders may be appropriate if there is evidence indicating that the authors believed they had IRB approval (#14617761), or that the paper's results are devoid of fraud/deception (#16832233). Determining the level of intent is less straightforward for this category. In general, ethics violations count as Intentional Deception, but uncertainty about author intent may warrant other coding choices. For example, the authors may have erroneously thought they received IRB approval (#14617761), or approval may have been o\u000ecially obtained only after the authors completed the study (#16842490). 10. Did Not Maintain Proper Records. Although the dataset only has three retractions that fall into this category, we include it as distinct retracting reason. The de ning characteristic of this category is absence of proper data records. With proper records, the scienti c community could better determine the reliability of the claims contained in these papers. Shaky Shoulders and Uncertain Intent are the proper complementary codes. 11. Publisher Error. Retractions occasionally stem from publisher mistakes rather than author mis- conduct or error. The associated notices establish that the publisher is solely responsible for the error, which is usually a duplicate publication (#17452723, #15082607) or printing of an earlier draft (#19662582, #15685781). Strong Shoulders is a natural t for publisher errors resulting from duplicates, while Shaky Shoulders is appropriate when the journal prints the wrong draft. By de nition, the proper intent coding is No Sign of Intentional Deception. 12. Not Enough Information to Classify or Missing. The essential di erence between these two categories is that we have a notice for the former and do not have a notice for the latter. \\Not Enough Information to Classify\" implies that the notice is so vague that we cannot assign another code.

Effect of Retraction on Related Papers We now turn to the core of the empirical analysis, exam- ining the effect of retraction on the citation outcomes for the related articles identi\u001eed by the PubMed Related Cita- tions Algorithm. The \u001erst set of results appears in table 6, which is structured analogous to table 5. Column 1 reports the difference-in-difference estimate for the entire sample. We \u001end that related articles experience a precisely estimated 5.73% decline in the rate at which they are cited in the post- retraction period, relative to the control articles. Column 2 shows that the estimate does not change after dropping the articles related to retractions for which we were unable to \u001end the underlying reason. Column 3 parses the retraction effect according to our shoulders coding. A clear differ- ence emerges between the fate of articles related to strong shoulders retraction and the fate of those related to either shaky shoulders or absent shoulders retractions. The articles related to strong shoulders retractions are essentially immune to the retraction event (in fact, the estimated effect is posi- tive, but also small in magnitude and not statistically different from 0). In contrast, the implied elasticities for the articles related to shaky shoulders and absent shoulders retractions are 8.70% and 6.20%, respectively (the corresponding esti- mates are not statistically different from each other). In other words, we \u001end evidence of negative spillovers of the retrac- tion event onto the adjacent research area, but only in the cases for which the underlying cause of the retraction sug- gests that follow-on researchers should proceed with caution (if proceeding at all) before building on the retracted papers results. By eliminating from the estimation sample the observa- tions associated with strong shoulders retractions, column 4 further documents that the negative spillovers stemming from the retraction event are of comparable magnitudes for articles related to both shaky shoulders and absent shoul- ders retractions. Column 5 retains only the \u001erst retraction event across retraction cases. Although the magnitude of the treatment effect shrinks somewhat, it remains negative and precisely estimated.18 The rest of our analysis focuses on the absent shoulders subsample of 589 retractions and 98,160 related and con- trol articles. Figure 2 provides a way of scaling the negative spillovers of retraction events onto their related \u001eelds by comparing the postretraction penalty experienced by related articles with the postretraction penalty experienced by the retracted articles themselves. In both cases, the penalty is measured by differencing the log number of cumulative cita- tions between 2011 and the year of the retraction event (using instead a \u001exed two-year window starting in the year of the retraction yields very similar results). The slope of the regression line is very close to .1, indicating that related articles lose, on average, only one-tenth of the citations lost by the retraction. We note that this ratio dovetails with that of the elasticities estimated in tables 5 and 6, respec- tively. Moreover, with an average of sixty related papers per retracted article, the aggregate citation consequences of the retraction events for the scienti\u001ec \u001eelds involved are not trivial. To provide a better sense of the magnitude of these aggre- gate losses, we estimate an analog of table 6 using OLS in section IV of the online appendix. The dependent variable is the number of citations received in levels. The results are substantially unchanged compared to our benchmark Pois- son speci\u001ecation. Furthermore, the citation decline estimated there (0.173 citation per year) can form the basis of back-of- the-envelope calculation. Using this estimate of the citation penalty and aggregating to the \u001eeld level (taking into account both the average numbers of articles per \u001eeld and the average length of the postretraction period in the sample), we con- clude that retraction-af\u001ficted \u001eelds experience, on average, a loss of 75 citations relative to control \u001eelds. Stated differently, 18 These results, reported as QML Poisson estimates in table 6, are consistent with results obtained from negative binomial regressions with bootstrapped standard errors.[¬e]\"",

The postretraction period refers to the years between the year of retraction and 2011 (using a two-year \u001exed window instead of this variable window yields very comparable results). The citation changes are computed by forming the difference in the logs of 1 plus the number of citations received by each article up to the beginning and the end of the postretraction window, respectively. The slope of the retraction line is about 0.1: for every ten citations lost by a retracted articles, related articles suffer a penalty of about one citation.\"\n\"this is as if we deleted from the average \u001eeld one paper in the top 7% of the distribution for the total number of long-run citations.\"\n\"Dynamics of the treatment effect. We also explore the dynamics of the effects uncovered in table 6. We do so in \u001egure 3 by estimating a speci\u001ecation in which the treatment effect is interacted with a set of indicator variables corre- sponding to a particular year relative to the retraction year and then graphing the effects and the 95% con\u001edence inter- val around them. Two features of the \u001egure are worthy of note. First, there is no discernible evidence of an effect in the years leading up to the retraction, a \u001ending that validates ex post our identi\u001ecation strategy.19 Second, after the retrac- tion, the treatment effect increases monotonically in absolute value with no evidence of recovery. Exploring heterogeneity in the effect of retractions. We explore a number of factors that could modulate the magni- tude of the retraction effect on intellectual neighbors citation rates. Table 7 reports the results of seven speci\u001ecations that include interaction terms between the retraction treatment effect and characteristics of either the retracted article or the retracted/related article dyad. Column 1 evaluates how the cumulative attention to the retracted article affects the reduction of citation to related articles. The rationale for this analysis is that citations are a proxy for the amount of atten- tion that scientists in the \u001eeld (and other related \u001eelds) gave 19 This \u001ending is also reassuring, as it suggests that retractions are not endogenous to the exhaustion of a particular intellectual trajectory; it does not appear as if researchers resort to the type of misconduct that yields retractions after uncovering evidence that their \u001eeld is on the decline.

The 95% con\u001edence interval (corresponding to robust standard errors, clustered around case codes) around these estimates is plotted with dashed lines. to the retracted paper prior to retraction and may be a predic- tor for the amount of collateral damage in a given \u001eeld. The coef\u001ecient on the interaction term shows that highly cited retracted papersthose in the top 25th percentile of citations at the time of retractionhave larger negative spillovers on citations to their related papers (8.0% versus 3.9%). How- ever, the additional decrease is not statistically signi\u001ecant at conventional levels. Columns 2 and 3 explore how publication trends at the \u001eeld level moderate the main retraction effect. In column 2, we consider how a \u001eelds hotnessthe extent to which a \u001eeld experiences elevated rates of entry in the years leading up to the retractionaffects the retractions effect on related papers, We de\u001ene a \u001eeld as hot when it is in the top quartile of all \u001eelds in terms of the percentage of papers published in either the retraction year or within three years.20 We \u001end that these very active \u001eelds feel the effect of a retraction (14.4%) more than colder \u001eelds (3.4%). Column 3 focuses on how the intellectual concentration of a \u001eeld intensi\u001ees the treatment effect of retraction. Our measure of crowdedness relies on the wedge between our ordinal measure of intellectual proximity and the cardinal measure returned by the PMRA. In some \u001eelds, the 25th most related paper published prior to retraction will be closely related to the retracted article, whereas in other \u001eelds, the 25th most related paper will be only a distant intellectual neighbor of the retraction. We label a \u001eeld as crowded if this 25th highest ranking related paper lies between the 75th and 100th per- centile for the relatedness score.21 As is the case with hot \u001eelds, we see that most of the negative spillover effects occur 20 The \u001eeld consists of all the related papers, as identi\u001eed by the PMRA algorithm, published in or before the retraction year. 21 In the rare cases where the \u001eeld has fewer than 25 papers published in or before the retraction year, the score of the least related paper is used.[¬e]\"",

Highly cited source articles are retracted papers that are in the top quartile of the citation distribution (assessed at the time of retraction). We de\u001ene the retracted papers \u001eeld as the set of related papers identi\u001eed by PubMeds PMRA algorithm. We measure recent activity in a \u001eeld by computing the fraction of papers in that \u001eeld published in the three-year period leading up to the retraction event. We denote a \u001eeld as hot if it belongs to the top quartile of this measure. We measure crowdedness in a \u001eeld using the relatedness score of the 25th highest-ranking related paper that was published in or before the retraction year. In the rare cases where the \u001eeld has fewer than 25 papers published in or before the retraction year, then the score of the highest-ranked (i.e., least-related) paper in the set is used. We denote a \u001eeld as crowded if it belongs to the top quartile of this measure. We derive the uncertain intent and intentional deception codes from retraction notices and publicly available information about the retraction event (see section II of the online appendix).

Columns 4 and 5 examine whether citation linkages between the related and retracted articles moderate the magnitude of the retraction treatment effect. Recall that relat- edness in the PMRA sense does not take into account citation information, only semantic proximity as inferred from MeSH keywords. Related articles can be published before the under- lying source, in which case they are at risk of being cited by it, or after the sources publication (but before its retraction), in which case they are at risk of citing the soon-to-be retracted publication. In column 4, we limit the estimation sample to the articles published after the retracted piece but before the retraction. In this subsample, we \u001end the negative retraction response to be especially pronounced (14.8%) for the 6.1% of articles that were directly building on the retracted arti- cles (as inferred by a citation link). Column 5, in contrast, restricts the estimation sample to the set of related articles (and their controls) that appeared before the retracted articles were published. We \u001end that the related articles that are also cited by the retraction experience a 6.1% boost in the citation rate following the retraction event. This result is consistent with the idea that the researchers who continue to work in the \u001eeld in spite of the retraction event choose to build instead on prior, unretracted research. The overall effect on the \u001eeld can still be negative since only a small fraction (7.9%) of articles related to the source are also cited by the source. Column 6 uses our coding of author intent to compare how the treat- ment effect of retraction differs in clear cases of fraud from fraud-free retraction cases or those with uncertain intent. We see that cases of intentional deception largely drive the neg- ative effect on the \u001eelds citations (7.8%), while \u001eelds that experienced retractions with no sign of intentional deception (the omitted category) had no citation decline on average. Figure D of section I in the online appendix explores the extent to which the age of a related article at the time of the retraction event in\u001fuences the magnitude of the treatment effect. In this \u001egure, each circle corresponds to the coef\u001ecient estimates stemming from a speci\u001ecation in which the cita- tion rates for related articles and their controls are regressed onto year effects, article age indicator variables, as well as interaction terms between the treatment effect and the vin- tage of each related article at the time of the retraction. Since related articles in the sample are published between one and ten years before their associated retraction event, there are ten such interaction terms.22 The results show that only recent articles (those published one, two, or three years before the retraction) experience a citation penalty in the postretraction period, whereas older articles are relatively immune to the retraction event. Finally, \u001egure 4 and \u001egure E (section I in the online appen- dix) investigate the extent to which relatedness (in the sense of PMRA) exacerbates the magnitude of the response. In \u001egure 4, we use the ordinal measure of relatednessnamely, the rank received by a focal article in the list returned by PMRA for a speci\u001ec source article.

We start from the premise that scientists employed by pro\u001et- seeking \u001erms would persist in investigating topics that university-based scientists (and NIH study sections) frown on (postretraction) as long as the possibility of developing a commercial product remains.28 We parse the forward cita- 25 We also \u001end this effect in models (unreported but available on request) in which we control for retraction size by including in the speci\u001ecation inter- action terms between the retraction effect and the quartiles of postretraction penalty at the retracted article level. 26 Another possibility, of course, is that researchers underreact to the dis- covery of honest mistakes. Though mistakes are likely more idiosyncratic than instances of fraud, one can think of instances where this is not the case, such as with the contamination of reagents or cell lines, as in the famous example of HeLa cells (Lucey, Nelson-Rees, & Hutchins, 2009). 27 We thank one of our anonymous referees for highlighting this alternative interpretation. The reviewer also noted the possibility that the wild goose chase effects of false science might contribute to the decreased citations and entry in affected \u001eelds, as scientists spend time trying to investigate and verify results related to the retracted paper. 28 We ground our assumptions regarding the potentially differential responses of academic- and industry-based scientists by appealing to prior work on differences in incentives and status concerns among academic and industrial scientists, the former of whom have principally, though not exclusively priority-based, incentives, and the latter of whom face stronger, though not exclusive, \u001enancial and organizational incentives that are not tion data to separate the citations that stem from private \u001erms (mostly pharmaceutical and biotechnology \u001erms, identi\u001eed by suf\u001exes such as Inc., Corp., LLC, Ltd., and GmbH) from those that originate in academia (broadly de\u001ened to include nonpro\u001et research institutes and public research institutions as well as universities). Even though we classify as pri- vate any citing article with a mix of private and academic addresses, almost 90% of the citations in our sample are aca- demic according to this de\u001enition. In table 9, columns 1a and 1b, we \u001end that academic and private citers do not differ at all in the extent to which they penalize the retracted articles. Con- versely, columns 2a and 2b indicate that private citers hardly penalize related articles, whereas academic citers do to the extent previously documented.29 The difference between the coef\u001ecients is statistically signi\u001ecant ( p < 0.01). These \u001end- ings are consistent with the view that the retraction-induced spillovers we have documented stem at least in part from aca- demic scientists concern that their peers will hold them in lower esteem if they remain within an intellectual \u001eeld whose reputation has been tarnished by retractions, even though these researchers were neither coauthors on the retracted article itself nor building directly on it.[¬e]\"",

Effect of Retraction on Retracted Papers Table 5 reports the results from simple difference-in- differences analyses for the sample of 1,037 retractions and 16 In section IV of the online appendix, we \u001end that OLS estimation yields qualitatively similar \u001endings. 1,922 nearest neighbors in the journals in which the retracted articles appeared.17 Column 1 reports the estimate of the retraction effect for the baseline speci\u001ecation. The result implies that relative to the controls, retracted papers lose 69% of their citations in the postretraction period. The mag- nitude of the effect is in line with the 60% decline estimated by Furman, Jensen, et al. (2012) in a smaller sample of PubMed-indexed retractions. Column 2 shows that the effect is barely affected when we drop from the sample those observations corresponding to retracted articles for which the retraction reason is missing. Column 3 includes in the speci\u001ecations the main effect of the retraction treatment as well as two interactions with the shaky shoulders and absent shoulders indicator variables. In this model, the main effect implicitly captures the post- retraction fate of the retracted papers that still maintain strong shoulders. While this effect is negative and statistically sig- ni\u001ecant (with an implied decrease in the citation rate equal to 38%), its magnitude is markedly smaller than that of the effect corresponding to the shaky shoulders retractions (66%) and smaller still than the effect for the absent shoulders cat- egory (73%). Dropping the strong shoulders group from the sample increases the magnitude of the retraction effect in absolute value (to 72%, column 4), while focusing on the ear- liest retraction event in each case slightly lowers the estimated effect (66%, column 5). In short, our results con\u001erm the earlier \u001endings of Fur- man, Jensen et al. (2012). In addition, the results in column 3 provide important empirical validation for the coding exer- cise detailed in the online appendix. Although the coef\u001ecients in this speci\u001ecation are not statistically different from each other, their magnitudes are ordered in an intuitive way, with the postretraction penalty decreasing monotonically with the strength of the shoulders provided to follow-on researchers. 17 Sixty-seven retracted articles needed to be dropped from the estima- tion sample because they appeared in journals not indexed by the Web of Science.[¬e]\"",

To delineate the boundaries of the research \u001eelds affected by retracted articles, we develop an approach based on topic similarity as inferred by the over- lap in keywords between each retracted articles and the rest of the (unretracted) scienti\u001ec literature. Speci\u001ecally, we use the PubMed Related Citations Algorithm (PMRA), which relies heavily on Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). MeSH terms constitute a controlled vocabulary maintained by the National Library of Medicine that provides a \u001enely grained partition of the intellectual space spanned by the biomedical research literature. Important for our purposes, MeSH keywords are assigned to each scienti\u001ec publication by professional index- ers, not by the authors themselves; the assignment is made without reference to the literature cited in the article. We then use the Related Articles function in PubMed to harvest journal articles that are proximate to the retracted articles, implicitly de\u001ening a scienti\u001ec \u001eeld as the set of articles whose MeSH keywords overlap with those tagging the ultimately retracted article. As a by-product, PMRA provides us with both an ordinal and a cardinal dyadic measure of intellec- tual proximity between each related article and its associated retraction. For the purposes of our main analysis, we consider only related articles published prior to the retraction date. We distinguish those published prior to the retracted arti- cle and those published in the window between the retracted articles publication date and the retraction event itself. We also exclude related articles with any coauthors in common with the retracted article in order to strip bare our measure of intellectual proximity from any associational baggage stemming from collaboration linkages. Finally, we build a set of control articles by selecting the nearest neighbors of the related articlesthe articles appearing immediately before or immediately after in the same journal and issue, as in Furman and Stern (2011) and Furman, Jensen et al.

We measure NIH funding for the same \u001eelds by summing the grant amounts awarded in a particular year that yields at least one publication over the next three years that is related to either a retracted article or one of their nearest-neighbor controls. The means and standard deviations are computed over all observations in the resulting retracted article/year panel data set (N × T = 53,451 for related article frequencies; N × T = 42,524 for funding).\"\n\"for each related publication, we identify the closest preceding year in a three-year window during which funding was awarded through either a new award or a competitive renewal. We then sum all the funding in the grant year that ultimately generates publications in the focal \u001eeld. The descriptive statistics for the \u001eeld-level analyses are displayed in table 4. The number of observations across the publication frequency data set and the funding data set dif- fer because the funding data are available only until 2007, whereas the publication data is available until the end of our observation period (2011) and we drop from the funding analysis the \u001eelds for which there is not a single publica- tion acknowledging NIH funding for the entire 19702007 period.[¬e]\"",

  "Abstract": "The current study is aimed at assessment of compliance of retraction notices for articles on mental disorders with COPE guidelines and impact of open access on post-retraction citation of retracted articles on mental disorders. A bibliometric search was carried out for retraction notices for articles on mental disorders using PubMed. Twenty-four (43.63%) articles were retracted in the year 2010 or later and 31 (56.36%) were retracted before 2010. A significantly. higher proportion of articles cited at least once post-retraction were without a freely accessible retraction notice (chi square = 10.06, df = 1, P = 0.002). Open access status of the article did not influence the times (in months) to retraction after publication (U = 321.00, P = 0.73).",

  "Abstract": "This study was aimed at assessing the retracted medical literature on mental disorders. Another aim was to test the hypothesis that the weak research infrastructure in certain countries and the rising pressure to publish in Asia due to the progress of science in that continent may have contributed to the increase in the number of retractions. A bibliometric search was carried out using the PubMed database. The data were analysed using SPSS version 21. The retraction rate for articles on mental disorders (number of retracted articles per 100,000 published articles on mental disorders) varied from a low of 3.56 (for 2005) to a high of 49.25 (for 2012). Of the 38 articles for which the reasons for retraction could be accessed, 10 (26.31%) were retracted for fraud. Overall, 0.0138% of all articles on the biomedical sciences were retracted. Of the articles on mental disorders, 0.0095% were retracted. There was a disproportionately greater number of retractions in the case of articles originating from low- and middle-income countries than high-income countries. Similarly, there was a disproportionately greater number of retractions in the case of articles originating in Asian countries than non-Asian countries.",

  "Abstract": "This study examines the nature of citations to articles that were retracted in 2014. Out of 987 retracted articles found in ScienceDirect, an Elsevier full text database, we selected all articles that received more than 10 citations between January 2015 and March 2016. Since the retraction year was known for only about 83% of the retracted articles, we chose to concentrate on recent citations, that for certain appeared after the cited paper was retracted. Overall, we analyzed 238 citing documents and identified the context of each citation as positive, negative or neutral. Our results show that the vast majority of citations to retracted articles are positive despite of the clear retraction notice on the publisher's platform and regardless of the reason for retraction. Positive citations can be also seen to articles that were retracted due to ethical misconduct, data fabrication and false reports. In light of these results, we listed some recommendations for publishers that could potentially minimize the referral to retracted studies as valid.",

The full text of the retracted article should not be freely available on platforms such as ScienceDirect or others. Although versions of these articles may appear elsewhere, the journal websites should not carry these versions and make it difÞcult for authors to download, read and consequently cite retracted articles. It is rather puzzling why retracted articles are freely available, while the huge majority of the commercial publishersÕ articles are behind a paywall.\"\n\"3. Publishers should closely collaborate with content aggregators and create a workßow where each retraction notice can be seen on all platforms. There were quite a few instances where we observed a retraction notice on the publisher platform with no parallel notice in content aggregators such as PubMed. In these cases, researchers who use only PubMed for example might think that the article that they are referring to is valid. 4. Although COPE (Committee on Publication Ethics) provides guidelines for editors on how to handle retractions (COPE 2015; Wager et al. 2009), there are no guidelines on what the editors and the publishers do when they notice references to retracted articles. COPE has more than 10,000 members (COPE 2016), and we believe it should provide guidelines also for handling post-retraction citations. Such guidelines might include recommendations such as clearly tagging retracted articles in the reference list or asking to remove such references altogether or ask the authors for clear explanation why the retracted paper is referenced. 5. In order to ease the identiÞcation of references to retracted articles during the peer review process, a database of retracted articles including the reasons for the retraction should be set up. As one of the reviewers of the article pointed out there are tools in some editorial systems that ßag notices linked to the cited article on PubMed.[¬e]\"",

  "Abstract": "There are three main reasons for retraction: (1) ethical misconduct (e.g. duplicate publication, plagiarism, missing credit, no IRB, ownership issues, authorship issues, interference in the review process, citation manipulation); (2) scientific distortion (e.g. data manipulation, fraudulent data, unsupported conclusions, questionable data validity, non-replicability, data errors—even if unintended); (3) administrative error (e.g. article published in wrong issue, not the final version published, publisher errors). The first category, although highly deplorable has almost no effect on the advancement of science, the third category is relatively minor. The papers belonging to the second category are most troublesome from the scientific point of view, as they are misleading and have serious negative implications not only on science but also on society. In this paper, we explore some temporal characteristics of retracted articles, including time of publication, years to retract, growth of post retraction citations over time and social media attention by the three major categories. The data set comprises 995 retracted articles retrieved in October 2014 from Elsevier’s ScienceDirect. Citations and Mendeley reader counts were retrieved four times within 4 years, which allowed us to examine post-retraction longitudinal trends not only for citations, but also for Mendeley reader counts. The major findings are that both citation counts and Mendeley reader counts continue to grow after retraction. © 2018 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary",

  "Abstract": "When a scientific article is found to be either fraudulent or erroneous, one course of action available to both the authors and the publisher is to retract said article. Unfortunately, not all retraction notices properly inform the reader of the problems with a retracted article. This study developed a novel rubric for rating and standardizing the quality of retraction notices, and used it to assess the retraction notices of 171 retracted articles from 15 journals. Results suggest the rubric to be a robust, if preliminary, tool. Analysis of the retraction notices suggest that their quality has not improved over the last 50 years, that it varies both between and within journals, and that it is dependent on the field of science, the author of the retraction notice, and the reason for retraction. These results indicate a lack of uniformity in the retraction policies of individual journals and throughout the scientific literature. The rubric presented in this study could be adopted by journals to help standardize the writing of retraction notices.",

  "Abstract": "Our study aimed to evaluate the trends of post retraction citations of articles reporting a radiology-imaging diagnostic method and to find if a different pattern exists between manuscripts reporting an ultrasound method and those reporting other radiology diagnostic methods. This study reviewed retractions stored in PubMed on the subject of radiology-imaging diagnosis to identify the motivation, time from publication to retraction, and citations before and after retraction. The PubMed database was searched on June 2017 to retrieve the retracted articles, and the Scopus database was screened to identify the post-retraction citations. The full text was screened to see the type of post-retraction citation (positive/negative) and whether the cited article appears or not as retracted. One hundred and two retractions were identified, representing 3.5% of the retracted articles indexed by PubMed, out of which 54 were included in the analysis. Half of the articles were retracted in the first 24 months after publication, and the number of post retraction citations was higher than the number of citations before retraction in 30 out of 54 cases (US methods: 9/20, other diagnostic methods 21/34, P-value = 0.2312). The plagiarism was the most common reason for retraction (31%), followed by repetitive publication (26%), and errors in data/manuscript (24%). In less than 2% of cases, the retracted articles appear as retracted in the text or reference list, while the negative citation is observed in 4.84% among manuscripts reporting an US diagnostic method and 0.32% among manuscripts reporting a diagnostic method other than US (P-value = 0.0004). No significant differences were observed when post retraction weighted citation index (WCI, no. of citations weighted by citation window) was compared to WCI prior retraction (P-value = 0.5972). In light of the reported results, we enumerated some recommendations that could potentially minimize the referral to retracted studies as valid.",

  "Abstract": "In 2009, Scott S. Reuben was convicted of fabricating data, which lead to 25 of his publications being retracted. Although it is clear that the perpetuation of retracted articles negatively effects the appraisal of evidence, the extent to which retracted literature is cited had not previously been investigated. In this study, to better understand the perpetuation of discredited research, we examine the number of citations of Reuben's articles within 5 years of their retraction. Citations of Reuben's retracted articles were assessed using the Web of Science Core Collection (Thomson Reuters, NY). All citing articles were screened to discriminate between articles in which Reuben's work was quoted as retracted, and articles in which his data was wrongly cited without any note of the retraction status. Twenty of Reuben's publications had been cited 274 times between 2009 and 1024. In 2014, 45 % of the retracted articles had been cited at least once. In only 25.8 % of citing articles was it clearly stated that Reuben's work had been retracted. Annual citations decreased from 108 in 2009 to 18 in 2014; however, the percentage of publications correctly indicating the retraction status also declined. The percentage of citations in top-25 %-journals, as well as the percentage of citations in journals from Reuben's research area, declined sharply after 2009. Our data show that even 5 years after their retraction, nearly half of Reuben's articles are still being quoted and the retraction status is correctly mentioned in only one quarter of the citations.",

However, there are many explanations regarding why these notes are not always accessible or available. Based on the authors work \u001fow when writing an article, several crucial steps can be identi\u001eed. Most authors start their background research from one of the major literature databases. It would be effective to clearly label all retracted articles in these databases; unfortunately, this is not always the case. While MEDLINE displays retraction notes most frequently, EMBASE is less reliable (Wright and McDaid 2011).\"\n\"When accessing a full-text article, authors have different options. The most common approach is via the journals website. In 2009, the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) published guidelines for journal editors on how to retract an article (Wager et al. 2009). Among other recommendations, the Committee suggested that retracted articles should be clearly marked on the journals website. They should not be removed, but their retracted status should be indicated as clearly as possible (Wager et al. 2009). Still, investigations repeatedly concluded that these guidelines are not generally implemented in all journals (Steen 2011; Decullier et al. 2013). Up to 32 % of the withdrawn articles are not labeled as retracted (Steen 2011; Elia et al. 2014). Therefore, authors may not be aware that they are reading (and quoting) a retracted article. In our study, we found only one letter (4 % of the total number of articles included) which was neither labeled as retracted on the journals website, nor on PubMed (Table 1).\"\n\"Increasingly, researchers search the web for copies of publications that are not accessible to them by private or institutional subscription. Many papers are available from the authors private website, institutional websites or dedicated research repositories (e.g., PubMed Central, Mendeley, ResearchGate). In a recent article, Davis addressed the problem of multiple online versions of the same article. He searched for retracted papers and found retraction statements in only 26 % of the articles available online (Davis 2012). Again, readers are left unaware of the papers status.\"\n\"Many authors build their own \u001eles and databases with quotable literature. While hardcopies are naturally not updateable, reference management software could potentially check for retraction notes. Unfortunately, this utility is currently missing in commercially available reference managers.[¬e]\"",

  "Abstract": "Background: The annual number of retracted publications in the scientific literature is rapidly increasing. The objective of this study was to determine the frequency and reason for retraction of cancer publications and to determine how journals in the cancer field handle retracted articles. Methods: We searched three online databases (MEDLINE, Embase, The Cochrane Library) from database inception until 2015 for retracted journal publications related to cancer research. For each article, the reason for retraction was categorized as plagiarism, duplicate publication, fraud, error, authorship issues, or ethical issues. Accessibility of the retracted article was defined as intact, removed, or available but with a watermark over each page. Descriptive data was collected on each retracted article including number of citations, journal name and impact factor, study design, and time between publication and retraction. The publications were screened in duplicated and two reviewers extracted and categorized data. Results: Following database search and article screening, we identified 571 retracted cancer publications. The majority (76.4%) of cancer retractions were issued in the most recent decade, with 16.6 and 6.7% of the retractions in the prior two decades respectively. Retractions were issued by journals with impact factors ranging from 0 (discontinued) to 55.8. The average impact factor was 5.4 (median 3.54, IQR 1.8-5.5). On average, a retracted article was cited 45 times (median 18, IQR 6-51), with a range of 0-742. Reasons for retraction include plagiarism (14.4%), fraud (28.4%), duplicate publication (18.2%), error (24.2%), authorship issues (3.9%), and ethical issues (2.1%). The reason for retraction was not stated in 9.8% of cases. Twenty-nine percent of retracted articles remain available online in their original form. Conclusions: Retractions in cancer research are increasing in frequency at a similar rate to all biomedical research retractions. Cancer retractions are largely due to academic misconduct. Consequences to cancer patients, the public at large, and the research community can be substantial and should be addressed with future research. Despite the implications of this important issue, some cancer journals currently fall short of the current guidelines for clearly stating the reason for retraction and identifying the publication as retracted.",

  "Abstract": "Context.— This study examined the impact of retracted articles on biomedical communication.\r\rObjective.— To examine publications identified in the biomedical literature as having been retracted, to ascertain why and by whom the publications were retracted and to what extent citations of later-retracted articles continue to be incorporated in subsequent work.\r\rDesign.— A search of MEDLINE from 1966 through August 1997 for articles that had been retracted.\r\rMain Outcome Measures.— Characteristics of retractions and citations to articles after retraction.\r\rResults.— A total of 235 articles had been retracted. Error was acknowledged in relation to 91 articles; results could not be replicated in 38; misconduct was evident in 86; and no clear reason was given in 20. Of the 235 articles, 190 were retracted by some or all of the authors; 45 were retracted by a person or organization other than the author(s). The 235 retracted articles were cited 2034 times after the retraction notice. Examination of 299 of those citations reveals that in only 19 instances was the retraction noted; the remaining 280 citations treated the retracted article either explicitly (n=17) or implicitly (n=263) as though it were valid research.\r\rConclusion.— Retracted articles continue to be cited as valid work in the biomedical literature after publication of the retraction; these citations signal potential problems for biomedical science.",

  "Abstract": "At times, there are reasons for authors to make a formal statement of retraction of work they publish in biomedical journals. This study examines 235 retracted articles and looks at the reasons for these retractions and citations to the articles subsequent to retraction. The primary reasons for retraction are error of various kinds (such as problems with method or sample, including contamination of samples) and misconduct. The 235 articles are cited a total of 2,034 times after retraction. This set of citations can be divided into two groups: citations that appear in journals included in the Abridged Index Medicus and those that appear in other journals included in MEDLINE. While most of the citations in these two groups of journals can be categorized as \"implicitly positive,\" 275 make explicitly positive mention of retracted articles. The implications for continued citation for biomedical research and clinical practice are discussed.",

As previously mentioned, the rationale for dividing the investigation into these two groups centers on the cen- trality of the joumals included in AIM to the clinical practice of medicine. This rationale does not mean that the non-AIM journals are not read or do not have an impact on research and practice. A chi-square test can be employed to determine if the two distributions rep- resent a good fit with one another. The computed val- ue of chi-square is 24.08, which indicates a significant difference between the AIM and non-AIM joumals (P < 0.05).\"\n\"Another matter of concern in this study is where in the citing articles do citations to retracted publications appear. Most research reports are divided into sections usually labeled introduction, methods, discussion, re- sults, and conclusions. Appearance of citations to re- tracted publications in the methods, results, or conclu- sion sections are likely to indicate a more substantive[¬e]\"",

However, some citing authors include retracted material in more substantive sections of their work. For instance, 107 citations occur in the methods sec- tion, 68 in the results section, and 4 in the conclusion. A number of citing articles are not divided into spe- cific section; citations appearing in these articles are not counted here. Such citation practice indicates that, to some extent, the retracted work represents forma- tive or evaluative information for the citing authors. The remaining citations occur in source documents other than research articles. Among the citations in items other than research articles, a total of 234 cita- tions appear in review articles, so, in a sense, these citations could be categorized as appearing in a dis- cussion of the topic in question.

In ninety-one articles, retraction oc- curred because of some kind of error. The categories of error that could be identified were: error in the methods or analysis (N = 23); problems with the data (N = 37); and problems with the sample, such as con- tamination (N = 31). A total of eighty-six papers were\"\n\"Table 1 Reasons for retraction\"\n\"retracted because of misconduct or presumed miscon- duct. Retraction was classified as being due to miscon- duct if the statement of retraction clearly admitted to wrongdoing on the part of one or more of the authors. Presumed misconduct referred to those instances where one or more of the authors raised serious ques- tions about the efficacy of the work done by other au- thors. For example, one retraction statement read, \"This article is retracted by its first author (T. Nitta) in agreement with his co-authors, due to several impor- tant inaccuracies. Dr. Steinman's name was used with- out his knowledge or permission. He discovered the inaccuracies and made them known to the Editor-in- Chief\" [22]. An additional thirty-eight articles were re- tracted because the authors could not replicate the re- sults. These articles were categorized separately be- cause it was not possible to determine if the results were not replicated because of unavoidable error or because of some wrongdoing. The remaining twenty articles were retracted for other, unclassifiable reasons. In three instances, the retractors were unclear as to reason; in three cases, idiosyncratic reasons were giv- en; in fourteen cases, no reason was given.

  "Abstract": "Retractions of articles and citations to retracted work continue to be a cause for concern. In 1999, Budd et al. found 235 retracted publications in the biomedical literature for a 30-year period. Nearly 40% were retracted because of misconduct. e current study found 1,164 retracted articles in the 12-year period between 1997 and 2009. Of the 1,112 articles included for analysis, 55% were retracted for some type of misconduct. While this number represents a small minority of the total number of publications in biomedicine, it is still substantial, and the impact of the retracted works can be significant. In PubMed, notifications of retractions are connected to the original publication; the retraction information appears when a retracted article is retrieved in a search. Citations to retracted articles should, theoretically, be minimal. Despite these notifications of retraction in PubMed and elsewhere, the articles continue to receive citations. The 1999 study found that the retracted articles received more than 2,000 post-retraction citations, with less than 8% of the citations acknowledging the retraction in any way. Preliminary examination of the present data set illustrates that continued citation remains a problem. Of 391 citations analyzed, only 6% acknowledge the retraction. Because of potential clinical and research implications of continued use of work retracted due to error and (especially) misconduct, the current study is intended to alert information professions and information users about the challenges inherent in the literatures of many fields, particularly biomedicine.",

Te remaining 14 papers received 325 citations, with one receiving 168. Of the 247 citing articles available at the authors’ institution, only 14 (6%) acknowledge the retraction in some capacity, including 3 self-cita- tions that deny any wrong-doing. Te clear majority of citations, 193 (78%), are mentions of the retracted papers as parts of literature reviews or other back- ground sections of the articles. Tese mentions are tacitly positive; that is, they imply that the retracted articles represent valid work. Perhaps of special note are the 40 citations (16%) that make substantive men- tion of the retracted papers. Tese mentions tend to occur in the methodology, fndings, or discussion sec- tions of citing papers. Tey describe the retracted arti- cles favorably and, at times, indicate that the retracted papers provided bases for the later work—all without acknowledging the retracted nature of the article. In 2005, 67 articles were retracted. Post-retrac- tion, the 67 retracted articles received 965 citations, with one receiving 126. Of the 144 citing articles ex- amined, only 8 (6%) acknowledged the retraction. Of particular interest are the post-retraction citations patterns of fve articles retracted in 2005 for miscon- duct (described below). Eric T. Poehlman retracted four articles in 2005, admitting that he “intentionally omitted a material data point” in order to make an association “appear more signifcant than was actually the case”19 and be- cause “reported data were falsifed and fabricated. ”20 Sox and Rennie confrm that work by Poehlman re- tracted in other years continues to be cited.21 Post- retraction, the four articles retracted in 2005 were cited 71 times.

  "Abstract": "A major challenge to formal scientific communication is the retraction of published works. This study includes a detailed analysis of retracted articles in biomedical literature, including categorization of the reasons for retraction. The examination covers the years 2010 through 2014. Analysis also includes citations to articles retracted between 2001 and 2005. The totality of the investigation is couched within the context of communication in the biomedical sciences and, to a lesser extent, of the formulation of theories of citation.",

  "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To analyze the causes of retracted publications and the main characteristics of their authors. METHOD: A descriptive cross-sectional study was designed including all retracted publications from January 1st, 2013-December 31st, 2016 indexed in PubMed. The causes of retraction were classified as: data management, authorship issues, plagiarism, unethical research, journal issues, review process, conflict of interest, other causes, and unknown reasons. Then, misbehaviour was classified as misconduct, suspicion of misconduct or no misconduct suspicion. RESULTS: 1,082 retracted publications were identified. The retraction rate for the period was 2.5 per 10,000 publications. The main cause of retraction was misconduct (65.3%), and the leading reasons were plagiarism, data management and compromise of the review process. The highest proportion of retracted publications corresponded to Iran (15.52 per 10,000), followed by Egypt and China (11.75 and 8.26 per 10,000). CONCLUSIONS: Currently, misconduct is the main cause of retraction. Specific strategies to limit this phenomenon must be implemented. It would be useful to standardize reasons and procedures for retraction. The development of a standard retraction form to be permanently indexed in a database might be relevant.",

Otherwise, the highest proportion\nof errors among single author papers, suggests that errors might be\nhigher when the control of errors falls to one person.\nOriginal articles are the most retracted, probably related to the\nhigh number of this publication type or perhaps because it is the\npublication type which has more quality thresholds.\"\n\"This lack of reli-\nability in identiﬁcation of authors would be solved if, as desirable,\nORCID identiﬁers became generalized.\"\n\"Remove traces only helps\nmisconduct researchers to hide and difﬁcult research in this ﬁeld.\nSimilarly, some retraction notes are clear and descriptive of the\ncause of retraction, but others do not provide information at all,\nor this is minimum, and do not allow to understand the cause\nof retraction.3[¬e]\"",

  "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe the biomedical journal characteristics that are associated with the retraction of papers. METHOD: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted. All papers retracted and indexed in PubMed from January 1(st) 2013 to December 31(st), 2016 were included. We used nine main categories to classify retractions: aspects related with data, authors issues, plagiarism, unethical research, journal issues, review process, conflict of interest, other, and unknown. These categories were further classified as: misconduct, suspicion of misconduct, or no misconduct. RESULTS: The proportion of retraction was 2.5 per 10,000 publications. Retractions appeared in 611 journals. During the study period, retraction due to misconduct was more frequent among journals with low-impact factor. Within these retracted publications, among low-impact journals the presence of misconduct was higher with a 73% compared to 61% for the high-impact journals (p=0.001). There were differences in the percentage of retractions due to misconduct regarding the journal classification category (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Retraction of publications is present in both high- and low-impact factor biomedical journals, but misconduct is more frequent among the papers retracted from lower impact journals. Measures before and after publication should be taken to limit misconduct.",

  "Abstract": "Objective: Corporate Integrity Agreements (CIAs), which can address authorship practices, typically require sponsors to check if individuals have been debarred, but don’t yet recommend checking if these individuals have authored retracted publications. Authors with misconduct retractions can be serial offenders (high-risk authors). We investigated 1) the feasibility of cross-matching debarment and retracted publications lists, and 2) how well debarment searching could detect retracted authors.\r\rResearch design and methods: For this quantitative and qualitative assessment, we exported (11/08/2015) data from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Debarment List and the MEDLINE Retracted Publications database (both freely accessible). Every debarred individual was checked against all authors of all retracted publications. Potential matches were further investigated to ensure cross-match validity. Searching time was recorded. A case study was conducted on the cross-matched author with the highest retraction record.\r\rResults: Cross-matching was feasible; each debarred author could be checked within 5 minutes. The FDA Debarment List (n = 139 entries; US focus) was less comprehensive than the Retracted Publications database (n = 4013 entries; global focus). There were only 2 (1.5%) matches between debarred individuals and retracted authors; both retracted authors were serial offenders for publication misconduct. The case study showed debarment didn’t occur until 2 years after 18 publications had already been retracted.\r\rConclusions: The Retracted Publications database, more global and  30-fold larger than the FDA Debarment List, could provide sponsors and agencies with a free, practical, timely, relevant, and comprehensive way to help avoid high-risk authors. Future CIAs, as well as Good Publication Practice guidelines and company policies, could consider recommending a Retracted Publications search before author engagement.\r\rAcknowledgments: The authors acknowledge project management support from Dr Thao Le (Envision Pharma Group).",

  "Abstract": "Retraction of flawed articles is an important mechanism for correction of the scientific literature. We recently reported that the majority of retractions are associated with scientific misconduct. In the current study, we focused on the subset of retractions for which no misconduct was identified, in order to identify the major causes of error. Analysis of the retraction notices for 423 articles indexed in PubMed revealed that the most common causes of error-related retraction are laboratory errors, analytical errors, and irreproducible results. The most common laboratory errors are contamination and problems relating to molecular biology procedures (e.g., sequencing, cloning). Retractions due to contamination were more common in the past, whereas analytical errors are now increasing in frequency. A number of publications that have not been retracted despite being shown to contain significant errors suggest that barriers to retraction may impede correction of the literature. In particular, few cases of retraction due to cell line contamination were found despite recognition that this problem has affected numerous publications. An understanding of the errors leading to retraction can guide practices to improve laboratory research and the integrity of the scientific literature. Perhaps most important, our analysis has identified major problems in the mechanisms used to rectify the scientific literature and suggests a need for action by the scientific community to adopt protocols that ensure the integrity of the publication process.",

  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Retraction of previously published scientific articles is an important mechanism to preserve the integrity of scientific work. This study analyzed retractions of previously published articles from surgery journals. METHODS: We searched for retracted articles in the 100 surgery journals with the highest SJR2 indicator grades. RESULTS: We found 130 retracted articles in 49 journals (49%). Five or more retracted articles were published in 8 journals (8%). The mean time between publication and retraction was 26 months (range 1 to 158 months). The United States, China, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom accounted for more than 3 out of 4 of the retracted articles. The greatest number of retractions came from manuscripts about orthopedics and traumatology, general surgery, anesthesiology, cardiothoracic surgery, and plastic surgery. Nonsurgeons were responsible for 16% of retractions in these surgery journals. The main reasons for retraction were duplicate publication (42%), plagiarism (16%), absence of proven integrity of the study (14%), incorrect data (13%), data published without authorization (12%), violation of research ethics (11%), documented fraud (11%), request of an author(s) (5%), and unknown (3%). In 25% of the retracted articles, other publications by the same authors also had been retracted. CONCLUSION: Retraction of published articles does not occur frequently in surgery journals. Some form of scientific misconduct was present in the majority of retractions, especially duplication of publication and plagiarism. Retractions of previously published articles were most frequent from countries with the greatest number of publications; some authors showed recidivism.",

  "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the number of retracted articles and to examine the reasons for retraction within the obstetrics and gynaecology literature. DESIGN: Retrospective review of the PubMed database. SETTING: N/A. POPULATION: Obstetrics and gynaecology articles published from indexation until June 2018. METHODS: Articles were identified using keywords for retracted articles in obstetrics and gynaecology. Descriptive statistics were performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of article retraction, the reasons given for retraction, and article demographics. RESULTS: A total of 176 articles were identified with a median time to retraction of 2 years; over three-quarters were retracted within the last decade (n = 136; 77.3%). The median journal impact factor was 2.5 (range of 0.26-52.67). Subspecialties with the highest number of retractions were gynaecological oncology (n = 76; 43.2%), gynaecology (n = 36; 20.5%), and obstetrics (n = 31; 17.6%). Among 176 first authors, 18 authors (10.2%) had two or more retracted articles. Clinical research articles accounted for approximately one-half of the retracted articles (n = 87; 49.4%). Among the clinical studies, 10.2% (n = 18) were randomised control trials, 16.5% (n = 29) were prospective trials and 13.1% (n = 23) were retrospective studies. Plagiarism (n = 40; 22.7%) and data falsification (n = 37; 21.0%) were the most common reasons given for retraction. CONCLUSION: Article retraction within the obstetrics and gynaecology literature is increasing. The most frequently cited reasons for article retractions were plagiarism, errors in data, fabricated results, article duplication, and compromised peer review. Consequences of article retractions to patient care and the scientific community can be significant. The thorough screening of manuscripts prior to publication should be prioritised. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: The rate of retraction in obstetrics and gynaecology is increasing; the most common reason for retraction is plagiarism.",

  "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to characterize retracted publications in emergency medicine. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Web of Science and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify all retracted publications in the field of emergency medicine. We also searched an independent website that reports and archives retracted scientific publications. Two researchers independently screened titles, abstracts and full text of search results. Data from all included studies were then independently extracted. RESULTS: We identified 28 retraction notes. Eleven (39%) articles were published by authors from Europe. The oldest retracted article was published in 2001. The 28 retracted papers were published by 22 different journals. Two authors were named on multiples retractions. The median impact factor of journals was 1.03 (0.6-1.9). Almost all studies were available online [26/28 (93%)], but only 40% had watermarking on the article. The retraction notification was available for all articles. Three (11%) retraction notices did not clearly report the retraction reasons, and most retraction notices were issued by the editors [14 (56%)]. The most frequent retraction reasons were plagiarism [eight (29%)], duplicate publication [three (11%)] and overlap [two (2%)]. Retracted articles were cited on average 14 times. In most cases, the retraction cause did not invalidate the study's results [17 (60%)]. CONCLUSION: The most common reason for retraction was related to a misconduct by the authors. These results can question the necessity to normalize retraction procedures among the large number of biomedical editors and to educate future researchers on research integrity.",

  "Abstract": "Retracting published scientific articles is increasingly common. Retraction is a self-correction mechanism of the scientific community to maintain and safeguard the integrity of scientific literature. However, a retracted article may pose a profound and long-lasting threat to the credibility of the literature. New articles may unknowingly build their work on false claims made in retracted articles. Such dependencies on retracted articles may become implicit and indirect. Consequently, it becomes increasingly important to detect implicit and indirect threats. In this article, our aim is to raise the awareness of the potential threats of retracted articles even after their retraction and demonstrate a visual analytic study of retracted articles with reference to the rest of the literature and how their citations are influenced by their retraction. The context of highly cited retracted articles is visualized in terms of a co-citation network as well as the distribution of articles that have high-order citation dependencies on retracted articles. Survival analyses of time to retraction and postretraction citation are included. Sentences that explicitly cite retracted articles are extracted from full-text articles. Transitions of topics over time are depicted in topic-flow visualizations. We recommend that new visual analytic and science mapping tools should take retracted articles into account and facilitate tasks specifically related to the detection and monitoring of retracted articles.",

  "Abstract": "The number of retracted articles with Chinese authors has raised much attention, but no systematic study has specifically explored the retraction of academic publications by researchers from mainland China. Here, we determined the characteristics of retracted publications from mainland China in the biomedical literature. We searched the Medline database through PubMed and Web of Science to identify retracted publications with first authors from mainland China. Data for 825 retracted studies were included in the analysis. The number and rate of retractions have increased since 1999. We found that 651 retractions were for articles published in journals with relatively low impact factors (< 5). Commonest reasons for retraction were plagiarism (192), errors (159), duplicate publication (143), and invalid peer review (137). Authors of retracted articles were from 28 of the 31 provinces in mainland China. The number of retracted articles from mainland China has shown an increasing trend. Misconduct was the primary reason for retraction. Retracted articles originated from most provinces in China and were published in numerous journals. These findings indicate that misconduct issues are widespread in China. Results of this study highlight the need to take measures to prevent misconduct among Chinese researchers.",

  "Abstract": "We draw on rational crime theory to help analyse 55 articles that have been retracted from 734 peer-reviewed journals in the field of economics. We highlight and discuss what these findings indicate regarding the nature and pattern of research malpractice in that discipline. Particular attention is given to exploring \"no reason\" retractions and the policy guidelines of publishers regarding retracted papers. We conclude that the frequent vagueness of retraction statements, and a reluctance to signal research malpractice, generally results in little damage to the reputation of caught, and known, offenders. Thus, a key deterrent to engaging in research malpractice is lacking. To reduce the incidence of research malpractice, we offer several recommendations for publishers and journal editors.",

  "Abstract": "Introduction: Between 0.02% and 0.04% of articles are retracted. We aim to: (a) describe the reasons for retraction of genetics articles and the time elapsed between the publication of an article and that of the retraction notice because of research misconduct (ie, fabrication, falsification, plagiarism); and (b) compare all these variables between retracted medical genetics (MG) and non-medical genetics (NMG) articles. Methods: All retracted genetics articles published between 1970 and 2018 were retrieved from the Retraction Watch database. The reasons for retraction were fabrication/falsification, plagiarism, duplication, unreliability, and authorship issues. Articles subject to investigation by company/institution, journal, US Office for Research Integrity or third party were also retrieved. Results: 1582 retracted genetics articles (MG, n=690; NMG, n=892) were identified. Research misconduct and duplication were involved in 33% and 24% of retracted papers, respectively; 37% were subject to investigation. Only 0.8% of articles involved both fabrication/falsification and plagiarism. In this century the incidence of both plagiarism and duplication increased statistically significantly in genetics retracted articles; conversely, fabrication/falsification was significantly reduced. Time to retraction due to scientific misconduct was statistically significantly shorter in the period 2006-2018 compared with 1970-2000. Fabrication/falsification was statistically significantly more common in NMG (28%) than in MG (19%) articles. MG articles were significantly more frequently investigated (45%) than NMG articles (31%). Time to retraction of articles due to fabrication/falsification was significantly shorter for MG (mean 4.7 years) than for NMG (mean 6.4 years) articles; no differences for plagiarism (mean 2.3 years) were found. The USA (mainly NMG articles) and China (mainly MG articles) accounted for the largest number of retracted articles. Conclusion: Genetics is a discipline with a high article retraction rate (estimated retraction rate 0.15%). Fabrication/falsification and plagiarism were almost mutually exclusive reasons for article retraction. Retracted MG articles were more frequently subject to investigation than NMG articles. Retracted articles due to fabrication/falsification required 2.0-2.8 times longer to retract than when plagiarism was involved. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

  "Abstract": "Background and objective: To analyse articles retracted due to irregularities by authors helps to determine the state of scientific integrity of a discipline or country. The Retraction Watch (RW) database is the largest worldwide database on retracted articles. The objective was to determine the reasons for and features of retracted biomedical articles by Spanish authors. Material and methods: A search was conducted in the RW database of 7 types of scientific articles from 9 biomedicine disciplines −biology, genetics, medicine, microbiology, neurosciences, nutrition, dentistry, public health and toxicology−, with at least one author working in a Spanish centre, and published between 1970 and 2018. The features of the articles and the reasons for their retraction were recorded. Results: Of the 18,621 retracted articles, 217 (1%) were by Spanish authors; 155 (74%) were on biomedicine and the types of articles of interest. In most cases, there were several reasons for retracting an article. Research misconduct (fabrication, falsification, plagiarism) and duplication were involved in 25% and 35% of the cases, respectively. Twenty-two percent of the articles were retracted due to errors by the authors or the journals. A dentist retracted 18 articles −all from the same journal and in the same year, 2018−, which accounts for 12% of all retracted biomedicine articles. Conclusion: The number of retracted biomedicine articles by Spanish authors is low. Research misconduct was a frequent reason, with a similar percentage of articles retracted due to honest errors. © 2019 Elsevier España, S.L.U.",

  "Abstract": "Background: Science is a dynamic subject with ever-changing concepts and is said to be self-correcting. One of the major mechanisms of self-correction is retraction of flawed work. Aim: To study the various parameters associated with retraction of scientific articles in 2012 and 2013 and discuss the current trends in article retraction over the period of 2 years. Materials and Methods: Data were retrieved from MEDLINE (via PubMed) using the keywords retraction of articles, retraction notice, and withdrawal of article in January 2014, and analysis of articles published in 2012 and 2013 was carried out. Results: A total of 155 articles in 2012 and 182 in 2013 were retracted, and original articles followed by case reports constituted major part of it. The most cited reasons for retraction were mistakes, plagiarism, and duplicate submission, and the time interval between submission and retraction had reduced in 2013. Conclusion: Although retracted articles constitute the tip of an iceberg, they are still a matter of major concern in the scientific world. So, editors should follow the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) guidelines and make an effective strategy in order to reduce such misconduct, as it reflects very adversely not only in the scientific community but also in the general public.",

However, plagiarism represents the second most common reason and this had increased significantly in 2013 as compared to 2012.\"\n\"Most of the articles retracted in biomedical literature are related to original articles, followed by case reports and review articles. [Table 1] shows that retraction of original articles and case reports had increased in 2013 because of mistakes (honest errors), plagiarism, duplicate publication, and fabricated data. So, we can say that there is more potential of providing fraudulent data in experimental studies than in other types of articles. Fraudulent data are not new in science.\"\n\"Journal editors may be reluctant to print retractions with sufficient information either because others may doubt on the expertise of the editorial team or due to the fear of legal actions by discredited authors. This shows some discomfort on the part of authors and journals in admitting mistakes. However, the impact of published retractions is, in part, determined by the researchers seeking them out. [15] Wager et al., [9] in their study of retractions between 1988 and 2008, found that 5% of the retracted articles did not state the reason for retraction.\"\n\"According to COPE, authors usually would not have grounds for taking legal action against a journal over the act of retraction if it follows a suitable investigation and proper procedures. COPE also states that journal editors should consider at least issuing an expression of concern if an investigation is underway, but a judgment will not be available for a considerable period of time. [16]\"\n\"Unfortunately, retraction notices take a long time to reach the target readers after the article is published and this remains a chronic problem. In the present study, we observed that publication of notice for retraction of articles took a long mean time of 2.8 years in\"\n\"This is an alarming situation since it is a disgraceful act in a scientific writing and represents one of the biggest challenges faced by\nthe scholarly world and andby far a grim form of delinquency in academics.\"\n\"However, retractions, as a whole, are quite rare\nand represent just a tip of an iceberg, i.e. mere upsurge in the quantity of publications does not indicate increased quality of\nresearch work in the country.\"\n\"Fraudulent data are not new in science.

  "Abstract": "Objective: To determine the accessibility of retracted articles residing on non-publisher websites and in personal libraries. Methods: Searches were performed to locate Internet copies of 1,779 retracted articles identified in MEDLINE, published between 1973 and 2010, excluding the publishers' website. Found copies were classified by article version and location. Mendeley (a bibliographic software) was searched for copies residing in personal libraries. Results: Non-publisher websites provided 321 publicly accessible copies for 289 retracted articles: 304 (95%) copies were the publisher' versions, and 13 (4%) were final manuscripts. PubMed Central had 138 (43%) copies; educational websites 94 (29%); commercial websites 24 (7%); advocacy websites 16 (5%); and institutional repositories 10 (3%). Just 15 (5%) full-article views included a retraction statement. Personal Mendeley libraries contained records for 1,340 (75%) retracted articles, shared by 3.4 users, on average. Conclusions: The benefits of decentralized access to scientific articles may come with the cost of promoting incorrect, invalid, or untrustworthy science. Automated methods to deliver status updates to readers may reduce the persistence of error in the scientific literature.",

Other literature indexes, such as Web of Science and Scopus, connect the original article to the retraction statement through citation linking, although this form of alert is far less explicit to the searcher. General search engines (e.g., Google and Google Scholar), while heavily employed by the academic and clinician as a tool for discovery [22, 33, 34], presently lack any formal mechanism to alert readers of significant corrections or retractions to the article. Upon implementation, CrossMark meta- data will be openly available to literature databases and search engines, allowing such update notices or links to be integrated into search results.\"\n\"2.

Before publishing The references included in journal manuscripts could be checked against the CrossMark database and tagged when retractions or corrections have been issued. A report would be generated for the journal editor, which would then be conveyed to the corresponding author. While there are valid reasons for citing a retracted paperto highlight its error, for instancemany citations are perfunctory in nature and are not required to understand the nature or significance of the research [35, 36]. The careful avoidance of citing invalid work (or contextualizing it within a clear negative citation) would help reduce the miscommunication of erroneous research to other readers.[¬e]\"",

  "Abstract": "CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Increased frequency of retractions has recently been observed, and retractions are important events that deserve scientific investigation. This study aimed to characterize cases of retraction within general and internal medicine in a high-profile database, with interest in the country of origin of the article and the impact factor (IF) of the journal in which the retraction was made. DESIGN AND SETTING: This study consisted of reviewing retraction notes in the Thomson-Reuters Web of Knowledge (WoK) indexing database, within general and internal medicine. METHODS: The retractions were classified as plagiarism/duplication, error, fraud and authorship problems and then aggregated into two categories: \"plagiarism/duplication\" and \"others.\" The countries of origin of the articles were dichotomized according to the median of the indicator \"citations per paper\" (CPP), and the IF was dichotomized according to its median within general and internal medicine, also obtained from the WoK database. These variables were analyzed using contingency tables according to CPP (high versus low), IF (high versus low) and period (1992-2002 versus 2003-2014). The relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated for plagiarism/duplication. RESULTS: A total of 86 retraction notes were identified, and retraction reasons were found for 80 of them. The probability that plagiarism/duplication was the reason for retraction was more than three times higher for the low CPP group (RR: 3.4; 95% CI: [1.9-6.2]), and similar results were seen for the IF analysis. CONCLUSION: The study identified greater incidence of plagiarism/duplication among retractions from countries with lower scientific impact.",

  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Retraction in Medline medical literature experienced a tenfold increase between 1999 and 2009, however retraction remains a rare event since it represents 0.02% of publications. Retractions used to be handled following informal practices until they were formalized in 2009 by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). The objective of our study was to describe the compliance to these guidelines. METHODS: All retractions published in 2008 were identified using the Medline publication type \"retraction of publication\". The notices of retraction and the original articles were retrieved. For each retraction, we identified the reason for retraction, the country of affiliation of the first author, the time to retraction, the impact factor of the journal and the mention of retraction on the original article. RESULTS: Overall, 244 retractions were considered for analysis. Formal retraction notices could not be retrieved for 9. Of the 235 retractions available (96%), the reason was not detailed for 21 articles (9%). The most cited reasons were mistakes (28%), plagiarism (20%), fraud (14%) and overlap (11%). The original paper or its location was found for 233 retractions (95%). Of these, 22% were available with no mention of the retraction. CONCLUSION: A standard retraction form could be helpful, with a check list of major reason, leaving the editor free to provide the reader with any further information. Original articles should remain available with a clear mention of the retraction.",

  "Abstract": "Background\r\rTo investigate fraud and errors, scientists have studied cohorts of retraction notices. These researches have been performed using a PubMed search on publication type “retraction of publication” which retrieves the notices of the retractions. We assessed the stability of the indexation of retraction notices over a 15-month period and what was the time-lag to get stability.\r\rFindings\r\rA search on notices of retraction issued in 2008 was repeated every 3 months during 15 months from February 2011. The first search resulted in 237 notices of retraction. Throughout the study period, 14 discrepancies with the initial search were observed (6%). We found that the number of retraction notices became stable 35 months after the retraction.\r\rConclusions\r\rThe time-lag observed in this study has to be taken into account when performing a PubMed search.",

The main reasons for retraction were mistakes 26.0% (n = 32), fraud 26.0% (n = 32), plagiarism 20.3% (n = 25), and overlap 8.1% (n = 10). In 100 (81.3%) cases, a mention of retraction was available on the original paper, in 15 (12.2%) there was no mention of retraction, and 8 (6.5%) papers were deleted. Compared to the previous cohorts, management of retraction has improved because 99.2% provided a clear reason, and 81.3% of original articles were available with a mention of the retraction. © 2018 The Author(s).",

  "Abstract": "Scientific retractions occur for a multitude of reasons. A growing body of research has studied the phenomenon of retraction through systematic analyses of the characteristics of retracted articles and their associated citations. In our study, we focus on the characteristics of articles that cite retracted articles, and the changes in citation dynamics pre- and post-retraction. We leverage descriptive statistics and ego-network methods to examine 4,871 retracted articles and their citations before and after retraction. Our retracted articles data was obtained from PubMed, Scopus, and Retraction Watch and their citing articles from Scopus. Our findings indicate a stark decrease in post-retraction citations and that most of these citations came from countries different from the retracted article's country of publication. Citation context analyses of a subset of retracted articles also reveal that post-retraction citations came from articles with disciplinary and geographical boundaries different from that of the retracted article.

The total number of post-retraction citations is substan- tially smaller, with 40,050 post-retraction citations by 38,134 AC to 3,223 AR. 210 AR were not cited post-retrac- tion.\"\n\"We found that AC, on average, cite AR, post-retraction, that have been retracted about 5 years ago (Mean = 5.02, SD = 4.05). In addition, we conducted a one-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test for non-normally distributed data to deter- mine difference between pre-retraction and post-retraction citation counts. We found that post-retraction citation counts were signiﬁcantly lower than pre-retraction counts (Z = -12.1, p < 0.001). This ﬁnding is consistent with prior studies that report a decrease of citations rates after retraction (Chen et al., 2013).\"\n\"Out of these 250 AR, 8 articles had no change in pre- vs. post- citation counts, 240 experienced a decrease in citation counts, and 2 articles had increased (though minimal) citation counts after retraction. We also found that on average, articles expe- rience a citation loss of 86.5% (Min = 0%, Max = 100%) after retraction. Our reported ﬁnding is much larger than what was found in (Pfeifer & Snodgrass, 1990), who found that articles lost about 35% of citations after retraction (their data consists of 82 articles retracted between 1977 and 1988, with 6-month washout period). One possible reason could be that retraction has received more attention and higher scrutiny (Steen, 2012).\"\n\"To take into account natural citation decay, we compared each AR to its similar articles, which we deﬁned as articles published in the same journal and on the same year. We com- pared the year when the AR reached half of its current cita- tions (YR) to the average year similar articles received half of its citations (YJ). In 127 of the 250 retracted articles, YR is before YJ, indicating that the retracted articles receive fewer citations over time compared to their similar articles. In 91 retracted articles, YR = YJ, while in 22 retracted articles,\"\n\"We also compared the percentage of citations received after the year of retraction for both the AR and its set of similar arti- cles. In 221 of out the 250 retracted articles, the percentage of citations received by AR after retraction (i.e. post-retraction citations) is smaller than the average percentage received by its similar articles. For instance, one article published in 2007 and retracted in 2013 received 4% of its citations post- retraction, while on average, its similar articles received 58% of citations after 2014. This analysis shows that the decrease in citations may be attributed to a retraction effect, rather than just a natural citation decay[¬e]\"",

  "Abstract": "The current mission statement of the Medical Library Association states that it is \"dedicated to improving health through professional excellence and leadership of its members in the ... provision of information services and educational programs ...\" With this goal in mind, retractions offer medical librarians a professional challenge to become involved in the scientific process. Through results of a survey conducted among the consortium of South Central Academic Medical Libraries (SCAMeL), this paper reveals opinions on the importance of retraction awareness and who is responsible for disseminating this knowledge. The paper also reports what the Louisiana State University Medical Center at Shreveport Library and other SCAMeL member libraries are doing to promote awareness.",

  "Abstract": "An increasing problem throughout the world, plagiarism and related dishonest behaviors have been affecting Indian science for quite some time. To curb this problem, the Indian government has initiated a number of measures, such as providing plagiarism detecting software to all the universities for free. Still, however, many unfair or incorrect papers are published. For some time, publishers have used an efficient tool to deal with such situations: retractions. A published paper that is later discovered to not deserve publicationwhich can be for a number of reasonscan be withdrawn (and often removed from the online contents of the journal) by the publisher. This study aims (1) to identify retracted publications authored orco-authored by researchers affiliated to Indian institutions and (2) to analyze the reasons for the retractions. To meet these aims, we searched the SCOPUS database to identify retraction notices for articles authored or coauthored by Indian authors. The first retraction notice was issued back in 1996, an exceptionally early retraction, as the next one was published in 2005. Thus, we analyzed 239 retractions (195 from journals and 44 from conference proceedings) published between 2005 and 3 August 2018 (but most were published after 2010), in terms of the following qualitative retraction-wise parameters: the main reason for retraction, authorship, a collaboration level, collaborating countries, sources of retraction (a journal or conference proceedings), and funding sources of the research. We also detected journals with high retraction frequencies. Mainly two phrasesRetraction notice to and Retracted Articlewere used to retract publications. The most frequent reason for retractions was plagiarism.",

Retraction reasons were clearly stated in 81% of the notices. This is quite a share compared to other studies, such as that by Aspura et al. (2018), with 27% of notices, and by Tripathi et al. (2018), with less than 5% of notices explaining the retractions. The most common reason was, unsurprisingly, plagiarism (which includes self-plagiarism). Surprisingly, the number of retraction notices for Indian authors due to plagiarism was lower than that in Chauhan’s (2018) research on plagiarism by Indian authors. He found that there were 385 articles in the SCOPUS database during the period 2002–2016. Fig- ure 3 shows the yearly numbers of retractions due to plagiarism; the trend fuctuated, with ups and downs and an average of 14 retractions due to plagiarism per year. Most retractions due to plagiarism were issued in 2008 and 2016, but 2018 will likely beat them, with 14 retractions till 3 August 2018 (data not shown in Fig. 3). Ironically, one of the articles retracted for plagiarism was itself about plagiarism: It was retracted due to a portion copied from the questionnaire for an expert study that presented a guideline on plagiarism with defnitions and strategies to prevent and detect plagiarism (“Develop- ment of a guideline to approach plagiarism in Indian scenario: Retraction” Indian Jour- nal of Dermatology, 60 (2), 2015, 210). Almost one-fourth of the retractions were due to fake data, error, or duplicate publica- tion. The share of duplicate publications (slightly over 5%) was much smaller than that reported for Korean medical journals (58%) (Huh et al. 2016). Author dispute, a fake review process, and a copyright issue together accounted for 5% of the retractions. Only four retractions (1.7%) due to a fake review process draw attention, given that Tumor Biol- ogy used this reason to retract as many as 107 articles in a single retraction notice (Stig- brand 2017), all of which were written by Chinese authors (Shan 2017). Similarly, one publisher retracted 58 articles of Iranian scientists due to a fake review process in a single day (Callaway 2016). In our study, one publication was retracted due to inappropriate citation. Other rea- sons—including misinterpretation of data, experiments not conducted, and a diferent experiment conducted instead of the one mentioned in the manuscript—accounted for 5% of retractions.\"\n\"Table 6 Reasons for retractions.

More and more instances of plagiarism are due to a lack of sufcient awareness on pub- lication ethics and research integrity among researchers, in particular on plagiarism (Dhin- gra and Mishra 2014). This lack of awareness might have been a small problem three or four decades ago, but these days—under the rat race and the publish-or-perish pressure—it has become quite a problem. Such pressure has not passed over India: For academic pro- motion, most Indian higher education institutions expect their academic as well as research staf to publish at least one paper in a journal indexed in SCOPUS or Web of Science. This does refect the publish-or-perish phenomenon: What counts is quantity, not quality.

  "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To study journals' responses to a request from the State Medical Association of Rheinland-Pfalz, Germany, to retract 88 articles due to ethical concerns, and to check whether the resulting retractions followed published guidelines. DESIGN: Descriptive cross-sectional study. POPULATION: 88 articles (18 journals) by the anaesthesiologist Dr. Boldt, that warranted retraction. METHOD: According to the recommendations of the Committee on Publication Ethics, we regarded a retraction as adequate when a retraction notice was published, linked to the retracted article, identified the title and authors of the retracted article in its heading, explained the reason and who took responsibility for the retraction, and when the retracted article was freely accessible and marked using a transparent watermark that preserved original content. Two authors extracted data independently (January 2013) and contacted editors-in-chief and publishers for clarification in cases of inadequate retraction. RESULTS: Five articles (6%) fulfilled all criteria for adequate retraction. Nine (10%) were not retracted (no retraction notice published, full text article not marked). 79 (90%) retraction notices were published, 76 (86%) were freely accessible, but only 15 (17%) were complete. 73 (83%) full text articles were marked as retracted, of which 14 (16%) had an opaque watermark hiding parts of the original content, and 11 (13%) had all original content deleted. 59 (67%) retracted articles were freely accessible. One editor-in-chief stated personal problems as a reason for incomplete retractions, eight blamed their publishers. Two publishers cited legal threats from Dr. Boldt's co-authors which prevented them from retracting articles. CONCLUSION: Guidelines for retracting articles are incompletely followed. The role of publishers in the retraction process needs to be clarified and standards are needed on marking retracted articles. It remains unclear who should check that retractions are done properly. Legal safeguards are required to allow retraction of articles against the wishes of authors.",

Also, only 48 (54%) full text articles were clearly and correctly marked as retracted; the others were not marked at all, or the text was either completely deleted or covered by an opaque watermark obscuring parts of the original information. A major issue was the lack of free access to both retraction notices and full texts of retracted articles; only 76 (86%) of all retraction notices and 59 (67%) of all retracted articles were freely accessible, and not all of those were freely accessible through PubMed but had to be accessed through alternative websites.\"\n\"Therefore, some editors and publishers may be inclined to consider ethical concerns as a minor problem only. NLM advises that articles may be withdrawn because of pervasive error or unsubstantiated or irreproducible data due to either misconduct or honest error. COPE advises journal editors to retract an article if they have clear evidence that the findings are unreliable, and that they should consider retracting a publication if it reports unethical research. The 88 articles by Dr. Boldt and co-workers do not clearly fit into any of these categories and there is not yet an agreement on how to handle a clinical research article that may not necessarily be unethical per se, but that was not officially approved by a competent ethics committee.\"\n\"Second, no reliable mechanisms exist to ensure that research articles warranting retraction (e.g. following an appropriate investigation) are actually retracted [7,10,14] although the COPE guidelines on cooperation between journals and institutions give\"\n\"our study shows that the performance of many\njournals is disappointing.

Retractions appear to be ‘‘unpopular’’ with both\neditors and institutions since they may shed doubt on the integrity\nof science, and on the expertise of the editorial team\"\n\"There is\nlittle agreement on what exactly requires a retraction [8], and lack\nof ethical approval does not fit into any of the conventional\ndefinitions of misconduct such as plagiarism, fabrication, or\nfalsification of data. Therefore, some editors and publishers may\nbe inclined to consider ethical concerns as a minor problem only.\"\n\"It is therefore possible that retraction was delayed or\nprevented because the articles did not fit into one of the ‘‘usual’’\ncategories requiring retraction. However, this reason was not\nmentioned by any of the editors who were contacted requesting an\nexplanation and this does not explain why the retractions failed to\nadhere to published guidelines.[¬e]\"",

COPE, for instance, states that retracted articles should not be removed from printed copies of the journal or from electronic archives but their retracted status should be indicated as clearly as possible. \"\n\"Fifth, a further unresolved issue refers to the ultimate control after a retraction has been initiated.

In our example, it was sometimes a publisher that decided not to retract an article because Boldts co- authors threatened legal action. This highlights, again, the central role of publishers in deciding whether an article is to be retracted or not.\"\n\"When\nmisconduct was recognised by the competent ethics committee,\nthe editors-in-chief of all journals involved decided to start a joint\nretraction process. However, the individual retraction processes\nwere handled independently by each journal, and did not follow a\nclearly defined common procedure.\"\n\"It has been claimed that, once an\ninstitution has identified fraud or significant error, it is then up to\nthe journals to respond promptly and properly [4,14]. However,\nthere is no clear guidance about who, within the ‘‘journal’’, should\ntake this responsibility.\"\n\"Most\neditors of journals that had failed to correctly retract some or all\narticles, referred us to their publishers, suggesting that they held\nthem responsible. As long ago as 1990 it was recognised that\nauthors, editors, reviewers, and librarians all needed to be involved\nin a multifaceted approach to address the continued use of invalid\ndata [15]; interestingly, publishers were ignored at that time. By\n2012, adequately dealing with scientific misconduct has become,\naccording to different guidelines, a joint mission for ‘‘authors,\neditors, and publishers’’ [16–18]. The exact responsibility of each\nactor, however, remains ill defined.\nFourth, recommendations on how full texts of retracted articles\nshould be labelled are also lacking\"\n\"The question remains, whether\nthe original content of these articles should be preserved. Some\nmay agree with one of the interviewed editors who argued that the\ndata were false and therefore valueless, so why leave it viewable?\nAn alternative argument may be that scientific data, even when\nfraudulent or unethical, belongs to the public and may serve future\nresearch, for instance, research into fraud, and that the\npreservation of the historical record, including all faults, mistakes,\nand corrections, is essential\"\n\"Finally, journal editors or publishers may be reluctant to issue\nretractions and to mark an article because they may fear legal\nactions by discredited authors. In our example, it was sometimes a\npublisher that decided not to retract an article because Boldt’s co-\nauthors threatened legal action. This highlights, again, the central\nrole of publishers in deciding whether an article is to be retracted\nor not. Today, the threat of legal action weighs heavily, especially\non smaller journals\"\n\"COPE also states that\njournal editors should consider at least issuing an expression of\nconcern if an investigation is underway but a judgment will not be\navailable for a considerable time [2]. None of the journals that\nfailed to retract an article has published such an expression of\nconcern.\"\n\"clearly marked and freely accessible electronically, and that the\noriginal information remains visible?\"\n\"Several guidelines\nindicate that editors are responsible for the final decision about\nretracting material, with or without cooperation of the authors,\nand additionally that they should ensure that retractions are\nlabelled in such a way that they are identified by bibliographic\ndatabases. There seems to be some contradiction here since we\nfound that some editors considered they were powerless against a\npublisher’s decision. Also, current guidelines do not specify who\nshould verify whether the retraction process has been implemented\ncorrectly.\"\n\"Our study shows that purging the\nliterature of fraudulent or unethical articles remains a technically\nchallenging process and highlights several weaknesses which must[¬e]\"",

          "Text": "Page 4:\n[¬s]\"No retraction notices had been pub- lished for nine of the articles (10%; five journals). Of these five journals, three (publishing four articles) had not published any retraction notice at all, one had published retraction notices for only two of six articles, and one had published a retraction notice for only one of two articles (Table 1). Retraction notices for the remaining 79 articles were published between May 2011 and October 2011. Each of the 79 retraction notices was linked, in Pubmed, to the retracted article; 55 (63%) notices were clearly identified as Retractions, one was labelled Statement, one Erratum, and 22 (originating from one journal) were not labelled at all and referred to an Editors Note named: Notice of retraction. 76 retraction notices (86%) were listed in the table of contents of the respective journals; in 52 (59%; nine journals) the complete reference of the retracted article was listed in the table of contents, and in 24 (27%; four journals) the retraction was listed in the table of contents but the reference was lacking. Three published retraction notices (two journals) were not listed in the table of contents. The formats of the retraction notices were consistent within each journal, but differed between journals (Table 1): 53 notices (60%) included the title of the retracted article, and 32 (36%) included the names of the authors in their heading. Twenty notices (23%; four journals) included both the title and the authors in their heading, and 14 (16%) included neither of them in the heading, but included the reference in the text of the retraction notice. Seventy-one retraction notices (81%) described who had taken responsibility for the retraction. Responsibilities varied across journals. In seven journals (48 retraction notices), the editor-in- chief signed the retractions, in three (ten notices), it was the editor- in-chief with the publisher, and in two (13 notices), responsibility was taken by the editorial board. In three journals (eight notices), there was no indication of who had retracted the article; for example, one stated, the following article has been retracted.... Reasons for the retraction were explicitly provided in the notices in 13 journals (49 retraction notices); in two journals (30 notices), the notice referred to an editorial that explained the context of the retractions. Sixty-seven retraction notices (76%) were accessible through Pubmed, nine retraction notices (10%; one journal) were accessible through an alternative weblink (ScienceDirect) but not through Pubmed, and three (3%; two journals) were not freely accessible. Overall, only 15 retraction notices (17%; three journals) were found to fulfil all predefined criteria for an adequate retraction notice (Fig. 1).\"\n\" Fifteen articles (17%) were not marked as retracted. Nine of these also lacked a retraction notice. Of the 73 articles (83%) that were marked as retracted, 48 (55%; eight journals) had transparent watermarks although in ten of those (11%; two journals), the watermark was almost invisible (Fig. 2). The other 14 articles (16%; four journals) had opaque marks across all pages that completely obscured parts of text, tables or figures (Fig. 3). Eleven articles (13%; all from one journal) had their entire content (i.e. text, tables, figures, references) deleted. In one journal, only seven of eight full texts were labelled with a watermark although retraction notices were published for all eight.[¬e]\"",

The roles and responsibilities of the different players must be unambiguously defined, and publishers must not be left out  in fact, they should probably have a central role. The mechanism for retracting articles published by a previous publisher (i.e. after a journal has switched publishers) needs to be resolved. It seems obvious that once a competent independent investigation has provided convincing evidence that an article should be retracted, it is the journals responsibility to issue a retraction notice, but it remains unclear who must take on that responsibility, the editor or the publisher. We suggest that it should be the publishers responsi- bility to adequately mark the full text of the retracted article, using a transparent rather than opaque watermark on each page. Deleting the content of the fraudulent article should be outlawed.\"\n\"Both retraction notices and retracted articles belong to the public\ndomain and should not be hidden behind access barriers or pay\nwalls. After a reasonable time period, it should be verified whether\nthe retraction process has been successfully implemented,\nalthough,\"\n\"but perhaps this role could be taken by the\ninstitution that carried out the investigation. And finally, legal\nsafeguards are needed that allow journal editors to retract\nfraudulent or unethical papers even against the wishes of authors\nand/or publishers.[¬e]\"",

  "Abstract": "Background: The overall similarity index (OSI) and highest similarity scores (HSSs) from a single source might help to predict the potential reasons for the retraction from the anesthesia journals. Methods: Retracted publications, from five highest impact anesthesia journals, were retrieved from the MEDLINE and journal archives and analyzed using a plagiarism detection software (iThenticate) and manually verified for citation characteristics, OSI, HSS, and the presence, extent, and location of the duplicate text. The validity of the OSI including and excluding quotations and references and the HSS in predicting the potential reasons for retraction were tested using the receiver operating characteristic curves. Results: Of the total 138 retracted original and corresponding articles identified, 131 articles were analyzed. Most of them had the HSS more than 40% arising from a single source. Extensive degree of plagiarism (OSI score >35%) was identified through the main text of all analyzed retracted articles. The areas under the curves indicate that the OSI including and excluding quotations and bibliography and the HSS had reasonable ability to predict plagiarism and fabrication with a perfect sensitivity rate and low specificity but were weaker at distinguishing ethical misconduct or inconsistent or erroneous contents. Conclusions: The study highlights the presence of significant plagiarism in the retracted anesthesia publications irrespective to the reasons for retraction. The high OSI and the HSS could be useful tools to identify the potential manuscripts with high risks for plagiarism and fabrication.",

  "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To comprehensively report on the characteristics of retracted publications in the field of dentistry. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed), PubMed Central, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases for dental retracted articles from database inception to 02 July 2018. In addition, we scanned the search engine Google Scholar, and the website, Retraction Watch (www.retractionwatch.com), for retracted dental articles. Two researchers independently screened titles, abstracts and full text of search results. Descriptive data was collected on each retracted article including reason for retraction, study type, journal impact factor, and time between publication and retraction. Regression models were used to evaluate the association between journal impact factor and retraction characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 138 retractions of dental articles were included. Reasons for retraction were misconduct (N = 100, 72.5%), with the most frequently reported misconduct being overlap/plagiarism and innacurate/falsified conducting and reporting (N = 53, 38.4%). In vitro (N = 39, 28.3%), case reports (N = 29, 21%) and narrative reviews (N = 19, 13.8%) were study design most frequently identified in retracted articles. The median time between article publication and date of retraction notice was 1 year (interquartile-range [IQR] = 0-2 years). More than half of the retracted articles (n = 82, 59.4%) were cited post-retraction. A retracted article reporting a randomized controlled trial was more likely to appear in journal with higher impact factor than a retracted case report (mean difference [MD] = 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2,3.1. Articles retracted after 2012 were likely to appear in journals with a lower impact factor (MD=-1.3; 95%CI=-1.8, 0.8). CONCLUSIONS: Research misconduct is the main reason for retraction of dental articles. A substantial proportion of these articles were still being cited after their retraction. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This report of dental retraction articles informs that more transparency is needed with data reporting in dentistry to improve writing practices in dentistry. A more complete report of retractions and their causes would provide more accurate information to inform researchers and editors to avoid or reduce future cases of retractions. More complete and accurate reporting would increase the overall trust in dental research.",

  "Abstract": "[Summary Points]\r\rCorrections to scientific papers have been published for much longer than retractions, and show little sign of a recent increase.\rThe number of journals issuing retractions has grown dramatically in recent years, but the number of retractions per retracting-journal has not increased.\rThe number of queries and allegations made to the US Office of Research Integrity has grown, but the frequency of its findings of misconduct has not increased.\rTherefore, the rising number of retractions is most likely to be caused by a growing propensity to retract flawed and fraudulent papers, and there is little evidence of an increase in the prevalence of misconduct.\rStatistics on retractions and findings of misconduct are best used to make inferences about weaknesses in the system of scientific self-correction.",

  "Abstract": "The honesty and integrity of scientists is widely believed to be threatened by pressures to publish, unsupportive research environments, and other structural, sociological and psychological factors. Belief in the importance of these factors has inspired major policy initiatives, but evidence to support them is either non-existent or derived from self-reports and other sources that have known limitations. We used a retrospective study design to verify whether risk factors for scientific misconduct could predict the occurrence of retractions, which are usually the consequence of research misconduct, or corrections, which are honest rectifications of minor mistakes. Bibliographic and personal information were collected on all co-authors of papers that have been retracted or corrected in 2010-2011 (N=611 and N=2226 papers, respectively) and authors of control papers matched by journal and issue (N=1181 and N=4285 papers, respectively), and were analysed with conditional logistic regression. Results, which avoided several limitations of past studies and are robust to different sampling strategies, support the notion that scientific misconduct is more likely in countries that lack research integrity policies, in countries where individual publication performance is rewarded with cash, in cultures and situations were mutual criticism is hampered, and in the earliest phases of a researcher’s career. The hypothesis that males might be prone to scientific misconduct was not supported, and the widespread belief that pressures to publish are a major driver of misconduct was largely contradicted: high-impact and productive researchers, and those working in countries in which pressures to publish are believed to be higher, are less-likely to produce retracted papers, and more likely to correct them. Efforts to reduce and prevent misconduct, therefore, might be most effective if focused on promoting research integrity policies, improving mentoring and training, and encouraging transparent communication amongst researchers.",

Part of the explanation might lie in the dis- proportionate attention paid to extreme cases of fraud. Within our sample, we observed that extreme cases of prolific retractors (authors of several retracted papers) tended to fall in the highest percentiles of productivity, even though their average journal impact was mediocre (Fig 3).\"\n\"Authors from countries that have misconduct policies of any kind had a higher average number of retractions per individual (they were, in other words, more likely to be prolific retractors), as would be expected if multiple retractions by one individual followed from thorough investigations. Authors from countries in which performance was incentivized, instead, did not have significantly more retractions per individual, as would have been pre- dicted by the pressures to publish scenario (Fig 4, see S1 File for results on first authors).\"\n\"Since these cases often represent spectacular examples of fraud, they tend to attract the\nattention ofthe scientific community and the mass media, and thus might contribute to rein-\nforcing a stereotype. Interestingly, these authors also tended to be male, so these extreme cases\nmight reinforce gender stereotypes, too (Fig 3).\"\n\"We cannot exclude that extreme cases ofprolific retractors might result from stronger incen-\ntives or pressures to publish, and future research should test this hypothesis.[¬e]\"",

First, whilst cash incentives might have detrimental effects on scientific integrity, as commonly suspected, other forms of performance stimulation cannot be said to increase the risk of scientific misconduct, and may have null or even positive effects. Second, since productive, high-impact scientists exhibit above-average integrity, the bulk of the iceberg of scientific misconduct is likely to be found amongst low-profile journals and me- diocre authors. Third, countries that still lack structures and policies to handle allegations of scientific misconduct are characterized by a higher risk to produce fraudulent papers, and are therefore most urgently in need of regulations. Indeed, our findings support recent evidence suggesting that scientific misconduct might be very high in developing countries [44,45]. Fourth, younger researchers and those working in situations in which mutual criticism is ham- pered might be at greater risk of engaging in scientific misconduct.\"\n\"This suggests that pressures to pub-\nlish, independent ofcareer stage, might at best represent a psychological risk factor, with highly\nsubjective effects.[¬e]\"",

  "Abstract": "Articles may be retracted when their findings are no longer considered trustworthy due to scientific misconduct or error, they plagiarize previously published work, or they are found to violate ethical guidelines. Using a novel measure that we call the “retraction index,” we found that the frequency of retraction varies among journals and shows a strong correlation with the journal impact factor. Although retractions are relatively rare, the retraction process is essential for correcting the literature and maintaining trust in the scientific process.",

Retractions often do not occur for years after publication (1, 18, 21, 90), which is perhaps understandable given the time required for other researchers to attempt to replicate results and for institutions to perform thorough in- vestigations (100), but this means that erroneous information remains in circulation for prolonged periods before correction (62). Moreover, it is disheartening that retracted articles con- tinue to be cited, sometimes for decades afterward (11, 24, 45, 63, 66, 88, 96).\"\n\"How- ever, without access to raw data, it is unrealistic to expect that even careful and highly motivated reviewers can detect all in- stances of falsi\u001ecation or fabrication.\"\n\"The increasing rate of retracted scienti\u001ec arti- cles is a disturbing trend.\"\n\" Further- more, retractions can erode public con\u001edence in science. Any retraction represents a tremendous waste of scienti\u001ec re- sources that are often supported with public funding, and the retraction of published work can undermine the faith of the public in science and their willingness to provide continued support.[¬e]\"",

We de\u001ened a retraction index for each journal as the number of retractions in the time interval from 2001 to 2010, multiplied by 1,000, and divided by the number of published articles with abstracts. A plot of the journal retraction index versus the impact factor revealed a surprisingly robust correlation between the journal retraction index and its impact factor (P \u0001 0.0001 by Spearman rank correlation) (Fig. 1). Although correlation does not imply cau- sality, this preliminary investigation suggests that the probabil- ity that an article published in a higher-impact journal will be retracted is higher than that for an article published in a lower- impact journal. The correlation between a journals retraction index and its impact factor suggests that there may be systemic aspects of the scienti\u001ec publication process that can affect the likelihood of retraction.[¬e]\"",

  "Abstract": "A detailed review of all 2,047 biomedical and life-science research articles indexed by PubMed as retracted on May 3, 2012 revealed that only 21.3% of retractions were attributable to error. In contrast, 67.4% of retractions were attributable to misconduct, including fraud or suspected fraud (43.4%), duplicate publication (14.2%), and plagiarism (9.8%). Incomplete, uninformative or misleading retraction announcements have led to a previous underestimation of the role of fraud in the ongoing retraction epidemic. The percentage of scientific articles retracted because of fraud has increased similar to 10-fold since 1975. Retractions exhibit distinctive temporal and geographic patterns that may reveal underlying causes.",

The time interval between publication and retraction varied according to the cause of retraction, with arti- cles retracted because of fraud taking substantially longer to retract (Table 2). A gradual trend toward increasing time-to- retraction over time was detected (Fig. 4A). Journal-impact factor did not correlate with time-to-retraction for manuscripts retracted because of error, plagiarism, or duplicate publication, but did exhibit a modest correlation for manuscripts retracted because of fraud in high-impact journals, which tended to exhibit a shorter time-to-retraction (Fig. 4B). A small number of authors were responsible for multiple retractions. Thirty-eight research groups with greater or equal to ﬁve retractions accounted for 43.9% (n = 390) of retractions for fraud or suspected fraud in the modern biomedical literature (Fig. S1). Nearly all retracted articles by authors with 10 or more retractions were retracted because of fraud (Table S2). This ﬁnding is attributable to the discovery of multiple fraudulent articles during the course of investigation of a single instance of fraud. For example, the re- traction of a 2010 Blood article by Sawada et al. (14) was fol- lowed in rapid succession by the retraction of 30 additional articles originating from the laboratory of Naoki Mori (Fig. S2).[¬e]\"",

A more modest increase in retractions because of error was observed, and increasing retractions because of plagiarism and duplicate publication are a recent phenomenon, seen only since 2005.

This practice suggests that under certain\ncircumstances, scientists continue to ﬁnd utility in retracted\narticles, particularly those retracted because of error, and\nsupports a policy of continued access to retracted articles as\nlong as detailed descriptions regarding the reasons for re-\ntraction are provided.[¬e]\"",

  "Abstract": "Among the many forms of research misconduct, publishing fraudulent data is considered to be serious where the confidence and validity of the research is detrimentally undermined. In this study, the trend of 303 retracted publications from 44 authors (with more than three retracted publications each) was analysed. The results showed that only 6.60% of the retracted publications were single-authored and the discovery of fraudulent publications had reduced from 52.24 months (those published before the year 2000) to 33.23 months (those published on the year 2000 and onwards). It appears that with the widely accessible public databases like PubMed, fraudulent publications can be detected more easily. The different approaches adopted by authors who had previous publications retracted are also discussed herein.",

  "Abstract": "Studies have indicated that the number and frequency of fraudulent publications being retracted are not subsiding even with greater awareness of such incidents in the recent decades. In this study, the trends of retraction period, number of citations and coauthors of 5 selected researchers who had >/= 15 fraudulent publications retracted were analyzed. The obtained results shows that the retraction period is 48.96 +/- 32.16 months for the 113 publications affiliated to the 5 studied researchers. There are a total of 180 coauthors with 6.40 +/- 3.26 coauthors per researcher's retracted publication. The linear regression analysis indicates that there is limited correlation (R(2) = .008) between the citation counts and retraction period. The p value for multiple F-tests to assess the number of coauthors to a fraudulent publication on an interresearcher basis is found to be ranging from < .001 to .458. It is also found that a better correlation (R(2) = .592) exists between the likelihood of a researcher to involve different individuals for isolated fraudulent publications while only selecting very few to be their frequent coauthors of their mischievous acts. With this study, the possible use of coauthors as a strategy for publishing fraudulent work and a potential approach to tighten coauthorship are discussed.",

  "Abstract": "To gain a better understanding of the problem of dealing with publications whose integrity is subsequently challenged, experience in a well-documented case of research fraud was reviewed. At the University of California San Diego, a faculty committee evaluated 135 publications of Robert Slutsky, MD, and reported to each of the corresponding 30 journals whether each article was valid, questionable, or fraudulent, requesting publication of the criteria and the conclusions. Journals responded slowly to this request; half required additional letters over a 2-year period to elicit a reply. Of the 13 journals that had only valid articles, 5 printed a statement to that effect. Statements concerning 46 of 60 nonvalid articles were eventually published. Journals' inconsistent identification of published statements made it difficult to retrieve them by electronic searching. Only 7 notices covering 15 articles were found by searching under the Medical Subject Heading \"Retraction of Publication\"; scanning the entire bibliography retrieved 18 articles with retraction notations. A poll showed that journals rarely have written procedures for responding to allegations of research misconduct; in our experience, journals were reluctant to accept authorized retractions or corrections when coauthors failed to act.",

  "Abstract": "Scientific articles are retracted infrequently, yet have the potential to influence the scientific literature for years. The only randomised controlled trial to explore the effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was retracted in 2008 due to falsified data. The objective of this research was to determine the frequency and nature of citations of this retracted paper. Web of Science and Google Scholar were used to determine the number of times the retracted article was cited. Citations were classified as either retraction acknowledged or retraction not acknowledged. The search was conducted on 6 August 2013 and updated on 25 March 2014. Results: The search resulted in 76 citations, of which 24 occurred prior to the retraction of the article. Of the 52",

This is an interesting suggestion, however at present there is no comprehensive retraction database available. The RetractionWatch blog [20] provides up to date information on article retractions, often providing further information beyond the retraction notice. However, this blog was established in 2010 and, while it occasionally investigates historical retractions, it does not claim to be and is not a comprehensive retraction database. Pubchase™ (California, USA) is an online cloud based library and search tool which can be used online or with smart devices (e.g., smart phones, tablets etc.), which collaborates with RetractionWatch to notify users when an article in their library has been retracted [21]. PubMed includes the retraction reference in the title of the article, making it obvious that the article has been retracted, and also allows users to search for retracted publications by filtering results with the article type “retracted publication”. This is useful for searches conducted through PubMed but does not assist in notifying readers who access the PDF directly.\"\n\"Therefore, the inclusion of the retraction notice as the first page of a PDF or watermarking the pages of the PDF as retracted would assist all readers, regardless of how they access the article. The guidelines published by the Committee on Publication Ethics provide other useful points on the requirements of a retraction notice [1].\"\n\"The Internal Medicine Journal clearly states on the HTML site that the article has been retracted and provides a link to the PDF which has the retraction notice as the first page of the article.[¬e]\"",

Google uses the users web history and geographic location to return relevant results to the user; to account for this the same search was conducted on the same day on a public computer, in the University of South Australia (City East campus) library, and in this instance three of the top 10 results returned referred to Matsuyama et al. [6] with no indication of the retraction. The top result in both cases was a summary of the Matsuyama et al. [6] article without indication of the retracted status. The majority of the results that referred to the retracted paper were published prior to the retraction on medical information websites such as WebMD. The information on these websites has not been corrected since the retraction of the article, nor is there any indication that the referenced material has been retracted.[¬e]\"",

  "Abstract": "Although the validity of knowledge is critical to scientific progress, substantial concerns exist regarding the governance of knowledge production. While research errors are as relevant to the knowledge economy as defects are to the manufacturing economy, mechanisms to identify and signal \"defective\" or false knowledge are poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate one such institution - the system of scientific retractions. We analyze the universe of peer-reviewed scientific articles retracted from the biomedical literature between 1972-2006 and comparing with a matched control sample in order to identify the correlates, timing, and causal impact of scientific retractions. This effort provides insight into the workings of a distributed, peer-based system for the governance of validity in scientific knowledge. Our findings suggest that attention is a key predictor of retraction - retracted articles arise most frequently among highly-cited articles. The retraction system is expeditious in uncovering knowledge that is ever determined to be false (the mean time to retraction is less than two years) and democratic (retraction is not systematically affected by author prominence). Lastly, retraction causes an immediate, severe, and long-lived decline in future citations. Conditional on the obvious limitation that we cannot measure the absolute amount of false science in circulation, these results support the view that distributed governance systems can be designed to uncover false knowledge relatively swiftly and to mitigate the costs that false knowledge for future generations of producers.

  "Abstract": "Aim To analyze mistakes and misconduct in multidisciplinary and specialized biomedical journals. Methods We conducted searches through PubMed to retrieve errata, duplicate, and retracted publications (as of January 30, 2014). To analyze publication activity and citation profiles of countries, multidisciplinary, and specialized biomedical journals, we referred to the latest data from the SCImago Journal & Country Rank database. Total number of indexed articles and values of the h-index of the fifty most productive countries and multidisciplinary journals were recorded and linked to the number of duplicate and retracted publications in PubMed. Results Our analysis found 2597 correction items. A striking increase in the number of corrections appeared in 2013, which is mainly due to 871 (85.3%) corrections from PLOS One. The number of duplicate publications was 1086. Articles frequently published in duplicate were reviews (15.6%), original studies (12.6%), and case reports (7.6%), whereas top three retracted articles were original studies (10.1%), randomized trials (8.8%), and reviews (7%). A strong association existed between the total number of publications across countries and duplicate (r(s) = 0.86, P < 0.001) and retracted items (r(s) = 0.812, P < 0.001). A similar trend was found between country-based h-index values and duplicate and retracted publications. Conclusion The study suggests that the intensified self-correction in biomedicine is due to the attention of readers and authors, who spot errors in their hub of evidence-based information. Digitization and open access confound the staggering increase in correction notices and retractions.",

  "Abstract": "The retraction of an original article aims to ensure that readers are alerted to the fact that the findings are not trustworthy. However, the present research suggests that individuals still believe in the findings of an article even though they were later told that the data were fabricated and that the article was retracted. Participants in a debriefing condition and a no-debriefing condition learned about the scientific finding of an empirical article, whereas participants in a control condition did not. Afterward, participants in the debriefing condition were told that the article had been retracted because of fabricated data. Results showed that participants in the debriefing condition were less likely to believe in the findings than participants in the no-debriefing condition but were more likely to believe in the findings than participants in the control condition, suggesting that individuals do adjust their beliefs in the perceived truth of a scientific finding after debriefing-but insufficiently. Mediational analyses revealed that the availability of generated causal arguments underlies belief perseverance. These results suggest that a retraction note of an empirical article in a scientific journal is not sufficient to ensure that readers of the original article no longer believe in the article's conclusions.",

  "Abstract": "Scientific misconduct appears to be on the rise. However, an accused researcher may later be exonerated. The present research examines to what extent participants adhere to their attitude toward a researcher who allegedly committed academic misconduct after learning that the researcher is innocent. In two studies, participants in an exoneration and an uncorrected accusation condition learned that the ethics committee of a researcher's university demanded the retraction of one of the researcher's articles, whereas participants in a control condition did not receive this information. As intended, this manipulation led to a more favorable attitude toward the researcher in the control compared to the exoneration and the uncorrected accusation conditions (pre-exoneration attitude). Then, participants in the exoneration condition learned that the researcher was exonerated and that the article was not retracted. Participants in the uncorrected accusation and the control condition were not informed about the exoneration. Results revealed that the exoneration effectively worked, in that participants in the exoneration condition had a more favorable attitude (post-exoneration attitude) toward the researcher than did participants in the uncorrected accusation condition. Moreover, the post-exoneration attitude toward the researcher was similar in the exoneration and the control conditions. Finally, in the exoneration condition only, participants' post-exoneration attitude was more favorable than their pre-exoneration attitude. These findings suggest that an exoneration of an accused researcher restores the researcher's credibility.",

  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The number of retracted scholarly articles has risen precipitously in recent years. Past surveys of the retracted literature each limited their scope to articles in PubMed, though many retracted articles are not indexed in PubMed. To understand the scope and characteristics of retracted articles across the full spectrum of scholarly disciplines, we surveyed 42 of the largest bibliographic databases for major scholarly fields and publisher websites to identify retracted articles. This study examines various trends among them. RESULTS: We found, 4,449 scholarly publications retracted from 1928-2011. Unlike Math, Physics, Engineering and Social Sciences, the percentages of retractions in Medicine, Life Science and Chemistry exceeded their percentages among Web of Science (WoS) records. Retractions due to alleged publishing misconduct (47%) outnumbered those due to alleged research misconduct (20%) or questionable data/interpretations (42%). This total exceeds 100% since multiple justifications were listed in some retraction notices. Retraction/WoS record ratios vary among author affiliation countries. Though widespread, only miniscule percentages of publications for individual years, countries, journals, or disciplines have been retracted. Fifteen prolific individuals accounted for more than half of all retractions due to alleged research misconduct, and strongly influenced all retraction characteristics. The number of articles retracted per year increased by a factor of 19.06 from 2001 to 2010, though excluding repeat offenders and adjusting for growth of the published literature decreases it to a factor of 11.36. CONCLUSIONS: Retracted articles occur across the full spectrum of scholarly disciplines. Most retracted articles do not contain flawed data; and the authors of most retracted articles have not been accused of research misconduct. Despite recent increases, the proportion of published scholarly literature affected by retraction remains very small. Articles and editorials discussing retractions, or their relation to research integrity, should always consider individual cases in these broad contexts. However, better mechanisms are still needed for raising researchers' awareness of the retracted literature in their field.",

The dataset includes 780 publications (17.5% of all retractions) which were retracted while in press, but after being posted on the publishers website. The percentage of all database entries (including articles, letters to the editor, etc.) for a given publication year which have been retracted (as of 17 Jul 2011) peaks at 0.0262% for 2006 in PubMed and 0.0111% for 2007 in WoS (Fig. 4B). Note that from 2001 to these peak years the percentage increases are only by a factor of 1.82 for PubMed and 3.82 for WoS (Fig. 4B) in contrast to the increase by a factor of 19.06 over the same period in Fig. 4A.\"\n\"Annual numbers of retractions have been increasing dramati- cally since 2001 (Fig. 4A, solid line). The effect of the growth of the published literature during the 10-year period from 20012010 is considered by comparing figures for these two individual years. Queries performed 17 Jul 2011 yielded ratios of total entries for 2010/2001 of 1.4 for WoS and 1.7 for PubMed. If counts for Total retractions Minus Repeat Offenders (TMRO) are adjusted for growth in the number of WoS records, the ratio of values for 2010/2001 decreases from 15.94 to 11.36 (Table 5).\"\n\"The number of ‘‘PubMed retractions’’ per year outnumbered\nnon-PubMed retractions until 2002, indicating the dominance of\nthe medical literature among retractions in the past (Fig. 1).\nHowever, roughly equal numbers have appeared each year\nthereafter, with 1,402 PubMed and 1,442 non-PubMed retractions\nappearing from the beginning of 2003 to 22 Sep 2011.[¬e]\"",

The role of publishers and bibliographic databases to properly mark retracted publications has been discussed [10]. The RetractionWatch (http://retractionwatch. wordpress.com) blog supplements the often minimal information retraction notices provide with that obtained directly from the authors, editors, or investigative committees involved. Passive online databases, such as the Retraction Database from Rutgers University (http://retract.rutgers.edu), are impractical as they require researchers to actively search for articles in their field. Solutions which do not require active and repetitive searching by researchers may be more effective. For example, CrossRefs CrossMark initiative (http://www.crossref.org/crossmark/) is designed to help researchers identify the latest, definitive, publisher-maintained version available for an article of interest, as multiple versions of articles are typically generated during the publishing process or through incorporation of information from erratum or retraction notices. Another possibility could involve linking a truly comprehensive retraction database to the widely used reference management software tools, such as EndNote. This tool would scan a researchers personal EndNote library whenever opened, or when importing new references, and alert the user when a match between a known retracted article and a library entry is found.\"\n\"These low proportions support the call for\nde-coupling the stigma of ‘‘misconduct’’ from article retraction,\nand partially explain the continuing citation of retracted articles\nwhich may contain data believed to be valid.\"\n\"The central\nrole of local authorities in investigating and providing evidence[¬e]\"",

  "Abstract": "In 2005 the scientific misconduct case of a noted researcher concluded with, among other things, the retraction of 10 papers. However, these articles continue to be cited at relatively high rates. The objectives of this paper are: (1) to track the retraction process of these papers, (2) to assess the impact of retraction on subsequent citation rates of these papers, and (3) to compare the citation history of these retracted articles and five other high-profile retraction cases. For Objective #1, all 5 articles to be Retracted were retracted and of the 4 to be Corrected, 2 were Retracted and 2 were Corrected. Eight PubMed and journal sites were identified where retraction messages could be conveyed; the number of retraction messages averaged 3.4+2.5 for these 9 articles. For Objective #2, an absolute \"cleansing\" did not occur. While it initially appears there was a relative \"cleansing\", as citation rates for these articles did decrease after retraction, the reductions in citation rates for these articles (-28%) were the same as those for matched non-retracted publications both by the same author (-28%) and by another investigator (-29%) over the same time frame. Relative to Objective #3, the results for this case are quite different from the 5 other cases assessing this issue, perhaps because of this investigator's \"citation inertia\" as a result of the small percentage of hisr papers that were retracted and the large number of citations to the articles prior to their retraction and to all of his published articles.",

  "Abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to quantify the number and explore the nature of citations of retracted articles in the radiation oncology literature occurring after publication of the retraction note. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A list of previously identified retracted articles within the field of radiation oncology was updated in June 2017. The number of publications citing retracted articles was quantified using Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus. Studies citing retracted publications after publication of the retraction note were individually assessed to determine the nature of the reference. RESULTS: Forty-seven retracted articles were identified for this study. Thirty-seven studies (79%) received 1017 citations before retraction, and 34 articles (72%) received 407 English and 169 foreign-language citations afterward. The average number of citations dropped from 22 to 11 after publication of the retraction note (95% confidence interval, 0.3-21.0, P = .043). Most postretraction citations occurred during the second year after the article's retraction, originated from North America and Asia (N = 124 each, 31%) and Europe (N = 122, 30%), and featured in original articles (N = 254, 62%) and reviews (N = 73, 18%). Of the 358 individually evaluable citing studies, 92% referenced the retracted article as legitimate work. Three guidelines and 15 systematic reviews and meta-analyses were also identified that cited retracted articles as valid work. CONCLUSIONS: Postretraction citations are an avoidable phenomenon. The results of the study emphasize the need for investigators to adhere to good research practices to mitigate the influence and propagation of flawed and unethical research. Journal editors, peer reviewers, and the broader radiation oncology readership should remain diligent in ensuring that citations of retracted work are identified and removed before, during, and possibly even after publication.",

All full-text articles and their corresponding retraction notices discovered to date have been made freely accessible. 34 (2) Check that all used references are current as part of your Þnal preparation for manuscript submission. When available, CrossMark is a simple and reliable way to ensure the most authoritative version of a study is being used. Most of the prominent radia- tion oncology and medical physics journals have implemented this for all articles published after 2013. (3) For articles for which CrossMark is unavailable, check the validity of cited publications via the jour- nalÕs website before use. (4) Regularly update personally curated libraries, particu- larly when commencing new research projects. (5) In the event that an author wishes to use retracted work or retracted and republished work, include the details of the retraction note within the refer- ences section, as would be done with studies with errata and corrigenda (refer to Appendix EA, available online at https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j. ijrobp.2018.11.014, as an example). Furthermore, for retraction-focused articles, it is suggested that retracted articles of interest be compiled and sub- mitted as a supplement.\"\n\"In terms of future directions, some strategies to decrease the citation of retracted articles have been suggested and trialed. Some of these include better tools to assist re- searchers, such as web browser and reference manager plug-ins, changes to journals and scientiÞc databases to improve the visibility of retracted articles and retraction notices, 35,36 automated alerts to authors who have cited retracted work to give them the opportunity to address whether it has any material impact on their work and to\"\n\"publish errata, 8,25 and even penalties for authors who cite invalid studies. 15 The use of Òretraction and replacement/republicationÓ strategies has also been raised 37 and was employed for an article screened for inclusion in the current study. 16 How- ever, although this is an innovative strategy used to ensure that valuable ßawed but correctable research is retained, it poses problems from the perspective of evaluating citations of these articles. In particular, differentiating between ref- erences to the uncorrected and corrected versions appears to be problematic in the absence of careful citation prac- tices and when articles are republished using the same Publisher Item IdentiÞer. Furthermore, the advent of comprehensive databases of retracted articles such as openretractions.com and the recently established database by the online blog Retraction Watch (http://www. retractiondatabase.org/), which as of April 2018 curates over 17,000 entries, now allows for the development of reference checking software. 22 If shown to be effective, these programs could potentially be used during the editorial process in parallel with plagiarism checkers such as iThenticate.[¬e]\"",

  "Abstract": "Retraction is a self-cleaning activity done in the global science community. In this study, the retraction of global scientific publications from 2001 to 2010 was quantitatively analyzed by using the Science Citation Index Expanded. The results indicated that the number of retractions increased faster compared to the number of global scientific publications. Three very different patterns of retraction existed in each field. In the multi-disciplinary category and in the life sciences, retraction was relatively active. The impact factor strongly correlated with the number of retractions, but did not significantly correlate with the rate of retraction. Although the increases in the number of publications in China, India, and South Korea were faster, their retraction activities were higher than the worldwide average level.",

These countries were USA (451), China (327), Germany (123), Japan (123), India (103), the UK (91), and South Korea (60). USA had the most number of publications and retractions. Nonetheless, the retraction activity index for USA was 1.09, which is within the worldwide average level. The scienti\u001ec pro- duction in the USA was huge, and comprised 29 % of the global production from 2001 to 2010. Thus, the activity index, in most cases, was dependent on USA data. China, India, and South Korea retraction activity indexes were 2.73, 2.35, and 1.46, respectively. The retraction activity indexes of Germany, Japan, and the UK were 1.09, 1.07, and 0.80, respectively. From 2001 to 2010, publications in the USA, Germany, Japan, and the UK increased 0.29-, 0.28-, 0.06-, and 0.24-fold, respectively. At the same time, global publications increased 0.47-fold. In addition, publications in China, India, and South Korea increased 2.91-, 1.36- and 1.53-fold, respectively.

  "Abstract": "Retractions of journal articles exclude fraudulent or erroneous research from legitimate science and perform boundary work. Analyzing retractions from different disciplines and focusing on their apologetic aspects, we find that these apologies shift between openly addressing emotional, normative, and social themes and concealing them in a more scientific style of communication. Their boundary work remains highly ambivalent: They alternate between scientific and nonscientific forms of speaking, portray unstable patterns of control and coercion, and avoid drawing a boundary between legitimate and nonlegitimate science. In line with the hypothetical nature of scientific knowledge, retractions thus leave boundary making to the future.",

  "Abstract": "Retractions solicited by authors following the discovery of an unintentional error-what we henceforth call a \"self-retraction\"-are a new phenomenon of growing importance, about which very little is known. Here we present results of a small qualitative study aimed at gaining preliminary insights about circumstances, motivations and beliefs that accompanied the experience of a self-retraction. We identified retraction notes that unambiguously reported an honest error and that had been published between the years 2010 and 2015. We limited our sample to retractions with at least one co-author based in the Netherlands, Belgium, United Kingdom, Germany or a Scandinavian country, and we invited these authors to a semi-structured interview. Fourteen authors accepted our invitation. Contrary to our initial assumptions, most of our interviewees had not originally intended to retract their paper. They had contacted the journal to request a correction and the decision to retract had been made by journal editors. All interviewees reported that having to retract their own publication made them concerned for their scientific reputation and career, often causing considerable stress and anxiety. Interviewees also encountered difficulties in communicating with the journal and recalled other procedural issues that had unnecessarily slowed down the process of self-retraction. Intriguingly, however, all interviewees reported how, contrary to their own expectations, the self-retraction had brought no damage to their reputation and in some cases had actually improved it. We also examined the ethical motivations that interviewees ascribed, retrospectively, to their actions and found that such motivations included a combination of moral and prudential (i.e. pragmatic) considerations. These preliminary results suggest that scientists would welcome innovations to facilitate the process of self-retraction",

  "Abstract": "Retraction notices appear regularly in many scholarly journals, especially top-tier journals of science and engineering. One disconcerting feature of this emergent genre is evasion of authorship, that is, the deliberate obscuring of who has authored a particular retraction notice. This communication illustrates and discusses problems of evaded authorship of retraction notices. To address these problems, it proposes that scholarly journals should require explicit authorship of retraction notices and the inclusion of core generic components such as the content to be retracted, the reason(s) for the retraction, the attribution of responsibility, and the expression of mortification.",

The deliberate evasion of authorship, together with the use of discursive strategies such as hiding agents of misconduct through the passive voice and avoiding the expression of an authorial stance, epitomizes some of the most common responsibility-evading strategies discussed in William Benoit's (1995) image restoration theory [14], and seeks to duck ethical sanctions.[¬e]\"",

  "Abstract": "Academic medical libraries have a responsibility to inform library users regarding retracted publications. Many have created policies and procedures that identify flawed journal articles. A questionnaire was sent to the 129 academic medical libraries in the United States and Canada to find out how many had policies and procedures for identifying retracted publications. Of the returned questionnaires, 59% had no policy and no practice for calling the attention of the library user to retracted publications. Forty-one percent of the libraries called attention to retractions with or without a formal policy for doing so. Several responding libraries included their policy statement with the survey. The increasing number of academic medical libraries that realize the importance of having policies and practices in place highlights the necessity for this procedure.",

  "Abstract": "Background Flawed or misleading articles may be retracted because of either honest scientific errors or scientific misconduct. This study explored the characteristics of retractions in medical journals published in Korea through the KoreaMed database. Methods We retrieved retraction articles indexed in the KoreaMed database from January 1990 to January 2016. Three authors each reviewed the details of the retractions including the reason for retraction, adherence to retraction guidelines, and appropriateness of retraction. Points of disagreement were reconciled by discussion among the three. Results Out of 217,839 articles in KoreaMed published from 1990 to January 2016, the publication type of 111 articles was retraction (0.051%). Of the 111 articles (addressing the retraction of 114 papers), 58.8% were issued by the authors, 17.5% were jointly issued (author, editor, and publisher), 15.8% came from editors, and 4.4% were dispatched by institutions; in 5.3% of the instances, the issuer was unstated. The reasons for retraction included duplicate publication (57.0%), plagiarism (8.8%), scientific error (4.4%), author dispute (3.5%), and other (5.3%); the reasons were unstated or unclear in 20.2%. The degree of adherence to COPE's retraction guidelines varied (79.8%-100%), and some retractions were inappropriate by COPE standards. These were categorized as follows: retraction of the first published article in the case of duplicate publication (69.2%), authorship dispute (15.4%), errata (7.7%), and other (7.7%). Conclusion The major reason for retraction in Korean medical journals is duplicate publication. Some retractions resulted from overreaction by the editors. Therefore, editors of Korean medical journals should take careful note of the COPE retraction guidelines and should undergo training on appropriate retraction practices.",

  "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine how many papers have been retracted or withdrawn, and for what reason, in journals relating to plastic surgery.PubMed and SCOPUS were used, with the search terms (retracted OR withdrawn) AND (article OR publication OR paper) AND {(plastic surgery) OR (cosmetic surgery) OR (maxillofacial surgery) OR (craniofacial surgery)}. The papers were analyzed and classified according to the reason for retraction or withdrawal, journal name, publication year, and author. In the PubMed and SCOPUS, 227 and 114 titles were found, respectively, from which 34 duplicate titles were removed. An additional 261 titles which did not include \"retracted\" or \"withdrawn\" were removed, leaving 46 papers and 6 mined papers were added. The 52 full texts (42 \"retracted\" and 10 \"withdrawn\") were analyzed.The most frequent reason for retraction or withdrawal was duplication (17, 32.7%) followed by the author's request (9, 17.3%), plagiarism (7, 13.5%), and lack of permission (5, 9.6%). Retraction was most common in Plast Reconstr Surg (6, 12%) followed by Aesthetic Plast Surg (4, 7.9%), Ann Plast Surg (2, 3.9%), J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg (2, 3.9%), and Surg Res (2, 3.9%). Most authors retracted a paper just once; however, 6 authors retracted a paper twice or more. The first retraction was found in 1991, and the number of retractions showed a tendency to increase over time. However, the duplication rate did not change over time (R = 0.178, P = 0.117).Journal reviewers, as well as production editors, should check for duplication, plagiarism, or permission-related problems.",

  "Abstract": "Though protection of human research subjects is universally recognized as a critical requirement for the ethical conduct of research, few studies have examined retractions of medical articles through apparent noncompliance with that requirement. From our survey of 99 retracted papers published from 1981 to 2011, we found that the basis for those decisions was poorly explained in retraction notices and that most of the articles continued to be cited. In retraction notices, the current manner of explaining failure to protect human subjects is misleading and confusing.",

Preserving fabricated data without proper explana- tion could undermine the meta-analysis of papers and sometimes influence clinical practiceespecially when the results have a particular clinical impact.

Different jurisdictions have adopted and set their own interpretations with respect to definition and scope, and ethical reviews are performed very differently in different parts of the world.\"\n\"The second feature concerns the retroactive effect of retraction of research results. The nullification of published data should be conducted in logical, rational manner: the findings in such papers have already been published and shared among readers and society.\"\n\" As Levine argued, repeating the same protocol after each retraction can also be inefficient and sometimes even raise another ethical problemthat of conducting the same test using new human research subjects (Levine, 2004). Research involving human subjects has to balance the well-being of indi- vidual participants with the pursuit of knowledge, and the question of whether a particular study is ethical should not be a matter of formality (Miller and Rosenstein, 2002)\"\n\" Accordingly, it has to be accountable and ACCOUNTABILITY IN RESEARCH 131[¬e]\"",

  "Abstract": "The informal sharing of scholarly documents greatly promotes the openness of science. The benefit of open access, however, comes with a cost when retracted articles persist, without notification of invalidation, on the publisher's website, public Internet and on various social media platforms. This study unfolds the secret life and journey of 10 highly cited retracted papers in terms of their presence in the ecosystem of scholarly communication. The study focuses on the post-retraction citations to retracted papers with emphasis on their presence on various social media platforms.",

  "Abstract": "Alerting readers to errata and retractions is a vital service which librarians have traditionally performed by adding notices to print journals. In the electronic environment, technology offers the capability of alerting readers more effectively than was ever possible in print journals. The authors sought to determine if publishers of biomedical electronic journals are indeed taking full advantage of technology to notify readers of errata and retractions. While data could not be gathered for quantifiable results, the authors observed a definite lack of standardization. The authors recommend that publishers make hypertext links between the original article and its correction or retraction in addition to posting a notice in the table of contents.",

  "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The paper presents data on the two problems of misconduct and marginality in management, business and economics (MBE) journals and their practices to combat these problems. DESIGN: Data was collected in three phases. First, all publicly retracted papers in MBE journals were identified through keywords searches in 7 major databases (n = 1329 journals). Second, a focused survey was distributed to editors involved in such retractions (n = 64; response rate = 28%). Finally, a survey was administered to all active journals in the seven databases to collect data on editors' perceptions and practices related to the two problems (n = 937, response rate = 31.8%). Frequency analyses, cross tabulations, and qualitative analyses of open answers were used to examine the data. RESULTS: 184 retracted papers in MBE journals were identified in 2005-2015 (no retraction was found before 2005). From 2005-2007 to 2012-2015, the number of retractions increased by a factor ten with an all-time high in 2015. The survey to journals with reported retractions illustrates how already a few cases of suspected misconduct put a strain on the editorial workload. The survey to all active journals revealed that 42% of the respondents had started to use software to screen all submitted papers, and that a majority recognized the problem of marginality, as indicated by salami-style submissions. According to some editors, reviewers easily spot such submissions whereas others argued that authors may submit thinly sliced papers in parallel to several journals, which means that this practice is only discovered post-publication. The survey question on ways to support creative contributions stimulated a rich response of ideas regarding editorial vision, engaged boards and developmental approaches. The study uses data from three specialized fields, but its findings may be highly relevant to many journals in the social sciences.",

  "Abstract": "Purpose: It aimed to investigate how many retracted articles indexed in KoreaMed were cited in both the Scopus and the Korea Medical Citation Index (KoMCI) databases and to investigate whether the frequency of post-retraction citations was different according to the presence of a retraction mark. Methods: Retracted articles from the KoreaMed database were collected on January 28, 2016. Scopus and KoMCI were searched for post-retraction citations, which were defined as citations 1 year after the retraction, excluding retraction-related citations. Results: The 114 retracted articles were found in KoreaMed. The proportion of retracted articles in KoreaMed, the Korean medical journal database, through January 2016 was 0.04% (114/256,000). On the journal homepage, a retraction mark was present for 49 of the 114 retracted articles. Of the 114 retracted articles, 45 were cited in Scopus 176 times. Of the 176 citations, 109 (of 36 retracted articles) were post-retraction citations. The number of citations in KoMCI, except for citations of retraction notices, was 33 (of 14 retracted articles). Of those citations, the number of post-retraction citations in KoMCI was 14 (of 8 retracted articles). The presence of a retraction mark did not influence post-retraction citations (P> 0.05). Post-retraction citations were frequent in the range of 1 to 3 years. Conclusion: Post-retraction citations that were found in both Scopus and the KoMCI occurred frequently for retracted articles in KoreaMed. Adoption of Crossmark is recommended as one choice to prevent post-retraction citations.",

If notices of retraction were removed, the number of cita- tions was 33 (of 14 retracted articles), including 14 post-re- traction citations of 8 retracted articles (Table 2, Dataset 1). The chronological occurrence of post-retraction citations is presented in Fig. 2 (Dataset 2). Post-retraction citations were frequent 1 to 3 years after the 1-year period subsequent to the retraction notification. We found that post-retraction citations could occur 10 years after the retraction announcement. Out of 114 retracted articles, 76 articles (66.7%) were pub- lished before 2009. Out of 76 retracted articles, the retraction announcements of 38 articles (50.0%) were published before 2009. Thirty-eight retracted articles were published from 2009.\"\n\"Key results: Citations of retracted articles indexed in Kore- aMed were frequent, and post-retraction citations were also frequent. Additionally, the presence of a retraction mark did not influence post-retraction citations. Out of 254,000 articles in KoreaMed, 114 were retracted (0.05%).\"\n\"Table 2.

  "Abstract": "Background: Retractions of scientific articles represent attempts to correct the literature. Our goal was to examine retracted surgical papers. Methods: NCBI PubMed database was queried using the search terms \"surgery,\" \"surg,\" or \"surgical\" and \"retracted\" or \"retraction.\" Article details were recorded. Results: There were 184 retracted surgical articles identified from 1991 through 2015. Average retraction time was 3.6 years. General (26%), Cardiac (22%), and Orthopedic (10%) surgery were most common. Reasons for retraction were duplication (35.3%), Institutional Review Board violations (18.5%), falsified data (14.7%), data errors (9.8%), author dispute (8.2%), plagiarism (7.6%), copyright violations (2.2%), financial disclosure violations (0.5%), and consent (0.5%). No reason for retraction was given in 8.7% of cases. Median IF was higher for administrative than content-related retraction reasons (3.0 vs. 2.0, P < 0.01). A paywall, requiring a subscription to read, restricted access to 23.4% of retraction notices. Conclusions: Article retractions occur across all fields of surgery for various reasons, both administrative and content-related. The majority of surgical retraction notices have a reason for retraction listed and do not require payment to read. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

  "Abstract": "The incidence of fraud, or scientific misconduct, has been much publicized of late. While not new, the case of John Darsee has played an important part in the literature of biomedical research for a number of years. Darsee was discovered to have fabricated the data which formed the bases for many articles and abstracts he published through 1981. The present study shows that, although a considerable amount of time has passed and some of his papers have been retracted, Darsee's work continues to be cited, and cited positively, in the literature on cardiology through 1990. The implications of this phenomenon are discussed. © 1992 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

  "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: It has been proposed that the scientific literature purges itself of articles known to be fraudulent. To test this, an investigation was carried out of post-retraction citations over a 19-year period in the Breuning case. METHODS: On 10 March 2008 a cited reference search was conducted (all languages, all document types) using the name 'Breuning SE*'. The time limit was 1989-2007 with an option to exclude self-citations. The search included the ISI Web of Science Database including the Science Citation Index Expanded, the Social Sciences Citations Index and the Arts & Humanities Citation Index. To ascertain the citation context, citations of Breuning were classified by two raters as affirmative, negative or neutral. FINDINGS: For the period 1989-2000 both negative and affirmative citations were found. For the period 2001-2006 only affirmative citations (even to retracted articles) were found, some in journals with higher impact factors than those citing the case as fraudulent. In spite of the small number of citations of Breuning's articles, it is alarming that the affirmative citing of fraudulent research has not completely ceased but continues 24 years post-retraction (retracted 1982, cited 2006). While the limitations of a single case study are conceded, the results challenge the belief of scientific literature purging itself of fraudulent material. CONCLUSIONS: Retraction databases and widespread availability of computer software to check lists of references free of charge in any database or the internet are called for. Moreover, if a paper is never formally retracted, software for searching author names in the internet for fully investigated and proven scientific misconduct might be developed. The ethical guidelines on duplicate publication for purposes of disseminating the information as widely as possible should be reviewed.",

In spite of the small number of citations of Breunings articles, it is alarming that the affirmative citing of fraudulent research has not completely ceased but continues 24 years post-retraction (retracted 1982, cited 2006).

  "Abstract": "Both the scientific community and the general public have expressed concern over scientific misconduct. The number of retracted articles has increased dramatically over the past 20 years and now comprises about .02% of the 2 million articles published each year. Retraction of publications available in large public databases can be analyzed as an objective measure for scientific misconduct and errors. In this project, we analyzed retractions of scientific publications using the Web of Science (WoS) and PubMed databases. We found that a power law is applicable to distributions of retracting authors and retracted publications with exponents of about -.6 and -3.0, respectively. Application of a power-law model for retracted publications implies that retraction is not a random event. Analysis of the retraction distributions suggests that a small fraction (1-2%) of retracting authors with >==5 retractions are responsible for around 10% of retraction. The probabilities for their repeating retraction are calculated using a statistical model: 3-5% likelihood of repeat retraction for authors with a single retraction at five years after the latest retraction and 26-37% for authors with five retractions at five years after the latest retraction. By focusing on those with repeated retractions, this analysis could contribute to identification of measures to reduce such repetition of retractions.",

  "Abstract": "Aim: Article retraction is a measure taken by journals or authors where there is evidence of research misconduct or error, redundancy, plagiarism or unethical research. Recently, the retraction of scientific publications has been on the rise. In this survey, we aimed to describe the characteristics and distribution of retracted articles and the reasons for retractions. Methods: We searched retracted articles on the PubMed database and Retraction Watch website from 1980 to February 2016. The primary outcomes were the characteristics and distribution of retracted articles and the reasons for retractions. The secondary outcomes included how article retractions were handled by journals and how to improve the journal practices toward article retractions. Results: We included 1,339 retracted articles. Most retracted articles had six authors or fewer. Article retraction was most common in the USA (26%), Japan (11%) and Germany (10%). The main reasons for article retraction were misconduct (51%, n = 685) and error (14%, n = 193). There were 66% (n = 889) of retracted articles having male senior or corresponding authors. Of the articles retracted after August 2010, 63% (n = 567) retractions were reported on Retraction Watch. Large discrepancies were observed in the ways that different journals handled article retractions. For instance, articles were completely withdrawn from some journals, while in others, articles were still available with no indication of retraction. Likewise, some retraction notices included a detailed account of the events that led to article retraction, while others only consisted of a statement indicating the article retraction. Conclusion: The characteristics, geographic distribution and reasons for retraction of published articles involving human research participants were examined in this survey. More efforts are needed to improve the consistency and transparency of journal practices toward article retractions.",

  "Abstract": "Scientific articles are retracted at increasing rates, with the highest rates among top journals. Here we show that a single retraction triggers citation losses through an author's prior body of work. Compared to closely-matched control papers, citations fall by an average of 6.9% per year for each prior publication. These chain reactions are sustained on authors' papers (a) published up to a decade earlier and (b) connected within the authors' own citation network by up to 4 degrees of separation from the retracted publication. Importantly, however, citation losses among prior work disappear when authors self-report the error. Our analyses and results span the range of scientific disciplines.",

  "Abstract": "Article retraction in research is rising, yet retracted articles continue to be cited at a disturbing rate. This paper presents an analysis of recent retraction patterns, with a unique emphasis on the role author self-cites play, to assist the scientific community in creating counter-strategies. This was accomplished by examining the following: (1) A categorization of retracted articles more complete than previously published work. (2) The relationship between citation counts and after-retraction self-cites from the authors of the work, and the distribution of self-cites across our retraction categories. (3) The distribution of retractions written by both the author and the editor across our retraction categories. (4) The trends for seven of our nine defined retraction categories over a 6-year period. (5) The average journal impact factor by category, and the relationship between impact factor, author self-cites, and overall citations. Our findings indicate new reasons for retractions have emerged in recent years, and more editors are penning retractions. The rates of increase for retraction varies by category, and there is statistically significant difference of average impact factor between many categories. 18 % of authors self-cite retracted work post retraction with only 10 % of those authors also citing the retraction notice. Further, there is a positive correlation between self-cites and after retraction citations.",

However, it covers only participating publishers. Editors can use this system to verify refer- ences. This would not help curb the rate of all citations to retracted work including self-cites. The Þnal stage of the publishing process may prove to be the best time to double-check citation validity. Though this task may seem tedious systems can be developed to automatically detect citations in digital format.\"\n\"Additionally a retractions database similar to the Rutgers retraction database (http://retract.rutgers.edu/) (which is no longer updated) could be maintained so that researchers could quickly search the names of authors they cited for a history of retractions. Editors could also use this site before making the choice to publish work to determine if the author they are publishing is citing retracted work or has a history of publishing retracted work.

  "Abstract": "The main causes of retraction of biomedical articles with affiliated authors in Spain, as well as factors to interpret this phenomenon are identified. A total of 132 retractations have been analyzed, being the first cause of retraction the fabrication/falsification of data. Duplicated or reused images, errors admitted and not malicious in the data or procedures, duplicate or fragmented articles, and plagiarism are also frequent retraction causes. Retractions are not frequent, accounting for only 0.11% of the production of Spanish authors. But beyond that, retractions are an important correction and alert mechanism for scientific publications that ensures the reliability of the medical literature, its quality and progress.",

  "Abstract": "The rise of scientific fraud has drawn significant attention to research misconduct across disciplines. Documented cases of fraud provide an opportunity to examine whether scientists write differently when reporting on fraudulent research. In an analysis of over two million words, we evaluated 253 publications retracted for fraudulent data and compared the linguistic style of each paper to a corpus of 253 unretracted publications and 62 publications retracted for reasons other than fraud (e.g., ethics violations). Fraudulent papers were written with significantly higher levels of linguistic obfuscation, including lower readability and higher rates of jargon than unretracted and nonfraudulent papers. We also observed a positive association between obfuscation and the number of references per paper, suggesting that fraudulent authors obfuscate their reports to mask their deception by making them more costly to analyze and evaluate. This is the first large-scale analysis of fraudulent papers across authors and disciplines to reveal how changes in writing style are related to fraudulent data reporting.",

  "Abstract": "We analysed how long it has taken for papers authored by Scott Reuben, Joachim Boldt and Yoshitaka Fujii to be retracted: investigations into these three anaesthetists have shown much of their research to be unethical or fraudulent. To date, 94% of their combined papers requiring retraction have been retracted; however, only 85% of the retraction notices were compliant with guidelines produced by the Committee on Publication Ethics. We contacted the Editors-in-Chief and/or publishers of all the journals containing articles that had been identified as requiring retraction but had not yet been retracted. In response to our enquiries, 16 articles have since been retracted; we have documented the journals' responses regarding the remaining papers and await further retractions in the future. There is room for improvement in the way that unethical or fraudulent papers are handled by journals and publishers, beyond the identification of the authors' misconduct.",

  "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the landscape of retractions of literature and to determine the prevalence of research misconduct in the field of urology. METHODS: Three databases (PUBMED, Embase, Retraction Watch) were queried for all retracted studies on urological topics in both urological and non-urological journals from April 1999 to March 2018. Two reviewers screened the records and determined the final list of articles to be included in the analysis. RESULTS: A total of 138 articles met the inclusion criteria. Over 80% of retractions occurred after 2009. Retractions originated from 76 different journals (13 urological journals) and 28 countries. The most common reasons for retraction were plagiarism (28%), fake peer review (20%), error (20%), and falsification of data (13%). Misconduct accounted for two-thirds of the retractions (n = 93). A large watermark, indicating retraction of the article, was present in 75% of the manuscripts. Articles were cited a total of 4454 times, 38% of citations happened after retraction. The majority of retracted articles related to urological oncology (70%). The highest number of retractions for an individual author was five. Rates of retraction among popular urological journals since 2010 have increased but remain a small proportion of all publications: BJUI, 0.189%; World Journal of Urology, 0.132%; European Urology, 0.058%; Urology, 0.047%; and Journal of Urology, 0.024%. CONCLUSION: Retractions of urological literature, similarly to retractions of other biomedical literature, have been rising over the last decade. The majority of these retractions stem from research misconduct. Despite retractions, flawed articles continued to be cited.",

  "Abstract": "Open scholarly communication benefits us with unprecedented open access to scholarly information and many innovations, but it requires adequate quality control. This study aims to identify the extent of online availability of retracted articles across all disciplines in early 2019. In all, 1,541 articles were identified in Web of Science, published between 2000 and 2018. Using Google, Google Scholar, and Sci-Hub, the full text of articles were searched on formal and informal platforms. The results showed that while even formal publishers could not comply with Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) guidelines (e.g., the lack of retraction alerts and open availability), most copies on informal platforms were non-Version of Record, lacking any information of retraction. This preliminary study showed online propagation and inadequate quality control of the retracted articles by scholarly communication platforms, particularly by informal platforms.

  "Abstract": "Retraction of scientific publications can unmask scientific misconduct. We undertook a survey of publication rates, for authors with multiple retractions in the biomedical literature, to determine whether they changed after authors' first retractions. We collected publication and citation data from Scopus for 100 authors with multiple retractions (either >10 retractions or 2-5 retractions) in the Retraction Watch database. Publication rates increased until the year of the first retraction and decreased rapidly thereafter. By 4 years after the first retraction, the proportion of authors actively publishing at least one paper/year was <50%, annual publication rates were <50% of the pre-retraction rate, and only 22% of authors had a publication rate >50% of their pre-retraction rate. There was no difference in the decline in publication rates between authors associated with a retraction for misconduct and those not associated with such a retraction. After the first retraction, citation rates of retracted papers declined whereas those of unretracted papers by the same authors remained unchanged. In summary, publication rates of authors with multiple retractions, most of whom were associated with scientific misconduct, declined rapidly after their first retraction but a small minority continued to publish regularly.",

  "Abstract": "Purpose\r\rTo assess the frequency and propagation rate of published errors in the oncology literature and to determine possible contributing factors.\r\rMethods\r\rWe reviewed 10 major oncology journals to determine variability in the online presentation of errata. Canadian oncologists were surveyed regarding characteristics that may influence error propagation. Errors published during 2004-2007 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO) and the Journal of the National Cancer Institute (JNCI) were classified as trivial or serious (that is, whether change in outcome was involved). The frequency of citation and error propagation was determined for serious errors.\r\rResults\r\rOf the 10 journals reviewed, 9 present links from the original article to the erratum; in 4 of those 9 journals, at least 1 link was missing. Survey results indicate that 33% of oncologists do not read errata, and 45% have read only the abstract when referencing an article. Although 59% of oncologists have noticed errors in cancer publications, only 13% reported the error. Together, JCO and JNCI published 190 errata, for an error rate of 4% ± 1% (standard deviation) annually; 26 of 190 errors were serious (14%). The median time from publication of the article to the corresponding erratum was 3.5 months for trivial errors as compared with 8.3 months for serious errors (p = 0.03). Error propagation in citations before and after publication of the erratum was 15% and 2% respectively (p < 0.01).\r\rConclusions\r\rError rates in high-impact oncology journals average 4%, which is likely an underestimate, because errors noticed by readers are not consistently reported. Propagation of serious errors decreases, but still continues, after publication of errata.",
  "Comments": "2 retracted articles are covered in their “serious error” category.\rFig 4 caption: \"Two articles were retracted completely: one for an error in the underlying science, and the second for forgery of data.\"\r\r“we found 14 citations of the 2 retracted articles published after publication of the retraction notice. All but 1 implicitly endorsed the retracted article.”\r\r“2 articles in our study were retracted; of 14 citations of those articles, 13 endorsed the cited article as valid research.”",

Of the 10 citations published after the errata publication date, 3 directly quoted incorrect outcomes data, 3 directly quoted incorrect doses, and 4 made qualifying statements that were no longer correct (the error had altered the conclusions of the original paper). The 10 cita- tions were published between 7 and 38 months after publication of the corresponding errata (median: 18 months, with 2 citations published within a year of publication of the errata). In addition to the citations that propagated seri- ous errors from the 24 non-retracted publications, we found 14 citations of the 2 retracted articles published after publication of the retraction notice.

  "Abstract": "Over the past few years, several major scientific fraud cases have shocked the scientific community. The number of retractions each year has also increased tremendously, especially in the biomedical field, and scientific misconduct accounts for more than half of those retractions. It is assumed that co‐authors of retracted papers are affected by their colleagues' misconduct, and the aim of this study is to provide empirical evidence of the effect of retractions in biomedical research on co‐authors' research careers. Using data from the Web of Science, we measured the productivity, impact, and collaboration of 1,123 co‐authors of 293 retracted articles for a period of 5 years before and after the retraction. We found clear evidence that collaborators do suffer consequences of their colleagues' misconduct and that a retraction for fraud has higher consequences than a retraction for error. Our results also suggest that the extent of these consequences is closely linked with the ranking of co‐authors on the retracted paper, being felt most strongly by first authors, followed by the last authors, with the impact is less important for middle authors.",

These results conÞrm that the discovery of fraud strongly affects the career of fraudulent researchers, putting an end to it in most cases.\"\n\" Figure 1 shows that the median IRP of co-authors of retracted papers quickly drops in the years following a retraction.\"\n\"Figure 1 also shows that IRP of authors in the control group evolves differently for Þrst, middle, and last authors. Although the median IRP is stable during the entire 11-year period for last authors, we see a higher variation for Þrst and middle authors. For Þrst authors, there is a sharp increase in the preretraction period, followed by a slight decrease. As for middle authors, the median IRP also increases in the preretraction, with a similar decrease in the postretraction period. This variation is most likely due to the fact that last authors are usually senior researchers with stable careers, whereas Þrst and middle authors can be transient authors who may not pursue a scientiÞc career.\"\n\"The median proportion of papers published before and after the retraction (Table 4) shows that co-authors suffer a signiÞcant decrease in IRP, no matter the reason for retrac- tion, with the exception of last authors of papers retracted for error, for whom the decrease in productivity doesnÕt prove to be statistically signiÞcant. Fraud cases, but not errors, have a signiÞcant impact on middle authorsÕ IRP.\"\n\"Thus, the extent of consequences felt by co-authors seems to be distributed in a way that is similar to the distribution of the credit received by the authors, with the Þrst and last authors being more affected by the scientiÞc fraud of their co-authors than middle authors.\"\n\"TABLE 3.

  "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of retraction on the citation of randomized controlled trials. METHODS: We used an interrupted time-series with matched controls. PubMed, CINHAL, Google and the Retraction Watch Database were searched. We identified retracted publications reporting the results of randomized controlled trials involving human participants with two years of available data before and after retraction. We obtained monthly citation counts across all articles for the 24 months before and after retraction, from Web of Science. We used a Poisson segmented regression to detect changes in the level and trend of citation following retraction. We also undertook a matched control analysis of unretracted randomized controlled trials and a sensitivity analysis to account for cases of large-scale, well-advertised fraud. RESULTS: We identified 387 retracted randomized controlled trial reports, of which 218 (56.3%) were included in the interrupted time-series analysis. A reduction of 22.9% (95% CI 4.0% to 38.2%, p = 0.02) was observed in the number of citations in the month after retraction, and a further reduction of 1.9% (95% CI 0.4% to 3.5%, p = 0.02) per month in the following 24 months, relative to the expected trend. There was no evidence of a statistically significant reduction among the matched controls. Authors with a large number of retractions saw a 48.2% reduction at the time of retraction (95% CI 17.7% to 67.3%, p = 0.01). Other cases had a more gradual reduction with no change at the time of retraction and a 1.8% reduction per month in the following 24 months (95% CI 0.2% to 3.4%, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Retractions of randomized controlled trial reports can be effective in reducing citations. Other factors, such as the scale of the retractions and media attention, may play a role in the effectiveness of the reduction.",

  "Abstract": "Objectives To assess why articles are retracted from BioMed Central journals, whether retraction notices adhered to the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) guidelines, and are becoming more frequent as a proportion of published articles. Design/setting Retrospective cross-sectional analysis of 134 retractions from January 2000 to December 2015. Results 134 retraction notices were published during this timeframe. Although they account for 0.07% of all articles published (190 514 excluding supplements, corrections, retractions and commissioned content), the rate of retraction is rising. COPE guidelines on retraction were adhered to in that an explicit reason for each retraction was given. However, some notices did not document who retracted the article (eight articles, 6%) and others were unclear whether the underlying cause was honest error or misconduct (15 articles, 11%). The largest proportion of notices was issued by the authors (47 articles, 35%). The majority of retractions were due to some form of misconduct (102 articles, 76%), that is, compromised peer review (44 articles, 33%), plagiarism (22 articles, 16%) and data falsification/fabrication (10 articles, 7%). Honest error accounted for 17 retractions (13%) of which 10 articles (7%) were published in error. The median number of days from publication to retraction was 337.5 days. Conclusions The most common reason to retract was compromised peer review. However, the majority of these cases date to March 2015 and appear to be the result of a systematic attempt to manipulate peer review across several publishers. Retractions due to plagiarism account for the second largest category and may be reduced by screening manuscripts before publication although this is not guaranteed. Retractions due to problems with the data may be reduced by appropriate data sharing and deposition before publication. Adopting a checklist (linked to COPE guidelines) and templates for various classes of retraction notices would increase transparency of retraction notices in future.",

  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Increasing awareness of scientific misconduct has prompted various fields of medicine, including orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, and dentistry to characterize the reasons for article retraction. The purpose of this review was to evaluate the reasons for and the rate of article retraction in the field of anesthesia within the last 30 years. METHODS: Based on a reproducible search strategy, two independent reviewers searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Retraction Watch website to identify retracted anesthesiology articles. Extracted data included: author names, year of publication, year of the retracted article, journal name, journal five-year impact factor, research type (clinical, basic science, or review), reason for article retraction, number of citations, and presence of a watermark indicating article retraction. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty articles were included for data extraction. Reasons for article retraction could be grouped into six broad categories. The most common reason for retraction was fraud (data fabrication or manipulation), which accounted for nearly half (49.4%) of all retractions, followed by lack of appropriate ethical approval (28%). Other reasons for retraction included publication issues (e.g., duplicate publications), plagiarism, and studies with methodologic or other non-fraud data issues. Four authors were associated with most of the retracted articles (59%). The majority (69%) of publications utilized a watermark on the original article to indicate that the article was retracted. Journal Citation Reports journal impact factors ranged from 0.9 to 48.1 (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 3.6 [2.5-4.0]), and the most cited article was referenced 197 times (median [IQR], 13 [5-26]). Most retracted articles (66%) were cited at least once by other journal articles after having been withdrawn. CONCLUSIONS: Most retracted articles in anesthesiology literature were retracted because of research misconduct. Limited information is available in the retraction notices, unless explicitly stated, so it is challenging to distinguish between an honest error and research misconduct. Therefore, a standardized reporting process with structured retraction notices is desired.",

  "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine how commonly articles are retracted on the basis of unintentional mistakes, and whether these articles differ from those retracted for scientific misconduct in authorship, funding, type of study, publication, and time to retraction. DATA SOURCE AND STUDY SELECTION: All retractions of English language publications indexed in MEDLINE between 1982 and 2002 were extracted. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers categorised the reasons for retraction of each article as misconduct (falsification, fabrication, or plagiarism) or unintentional error (mistakes in sampling, procedures, or data analysis; failure to reproduce findings; accidental omission of information about methods or data analysis). DATA SYNTHESIS: Of the 395 articles retracted between 1982 and 2002, 107 (27.1%) were retracted because of scientific misconduct, 244 (61.8%) because of unintentional errors, and 44 (11.1%) could not be categorised. Compared with articles retracted because of misconduct, articles with unintentional mistakes were more likely to have multiple authors, no reported funding source, and to be published in frequently cited journals. They were more likely to be retracted by the author(s) of the article, and the retraction was more likely to occur more promptly (mean, 2.0 years; 95% CI, 1.8-2.2) than articles withdrawn because of misconduct (mean, 3.3 years; 95% CI, 2.7-3.9) (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: Retractions in the biomedical literature were more than twice as likely to result from unintentional mistakes than from scientific misconduct. The different characteristics of articles retracted for misconduct and for mistakes reflect distinct causes and, potentially, distinct solutions.",

  "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to identify and describe published research articles that were named in official findings of scientific misconduct and to investigate compliance with the administrative actions contained in these reports for corrections and retractions, as represented in PubMed. Between 1993 and 2001, 102 articles were named in either the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts (\"Findings of Scientific Misconduct\") or the U.S. Office of Research Integrity annual reports as needing retraction or correction. In 2002, 98 of the 102 articles were indexed in PubMed. Eighty-five of these 98 articles had indexed corrections: 47 were retracted; 26 had an erratum; 12 had a correction described in the \"comment\" field. Thirteen had no correction, but 10 were linked to the NIH Guide \"Findings of Scientific Misconduct\", leaving only 3 articles with no indication of any sort of problem. As of May 2005, there were 5,393 citations to the 102 articles, with a median of 26 citations per article (range 0-592). Researchers should be alert to \"Comments\" linked to the NIH Guide as these are open access, and the \"Findings of Scientific Misconduct' reports are often more informative than the statements about the retraction or correction found in the journals.",

  "Abstract": "We describe the ongoing citations to biomedical articles affected by scientific misconduct, and characterize the papers that cite these affected articles. The citations to 102 articles named in official findings of scientific misconduct during the period of 1993 and 2001 were identified through the Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science database. Using a stratified random sampling strategy, we performed a content analysis of 603 of the 5,393 citing papers to identify indications of awareness that the cited articles affected by scientific misconduct had validity issues, and to examine how the citing papers referred to the affected articles. Fewer than 5% of citing papers indicated any awareness that the cited article was retracted or named in a finding of misconduct. We also tested the hypothesis that affected articles would have fewer citations than a comparison sample; this was not supported. Most articles affected by misconduct were published in basic science journals, and we found little cause for concern that such articles may have affected clinical equipoise or clinical care.",

  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Publication retraction is a mechanism to preserve the scientific literature against publications that contain seriously flawed or erroneous data, redundant publication, plagiarism, unethical research, and other features that compromise the integrity of science. An increase in the occurrence of retractions in recent years has been reported. Nevertheless, there is scarce information on this topic concerning publications in dentistry and related specialties. Thus, this study aimed to investigate retracted papers published in dental journals. METHODS: Data collection included an exploratory search in PubMed and a specific search in SCImago Journal Rank indexed journals, complemented by the cases reported on the Retraction Watch website and in PubMed. All 167 dental journals included in SCImago were searched for identification of retracted articles up to March 2016. The selected retracted articles and their corresponding retraction notices were recorded and assessed for classification according to the reason for retraction and other additional information. RESULTS: Forty of the 167 journals scrutinised at SCImago (23.9%) had at least one retracted article, and four additional journals were identified from the Retraction Watch website. A total of 72 retracted found were retracted for the reasons: redundant publication (20.8%), plagiarism (18.1%), misconduct (13.8%), overlap (13.6%) and honest error (9.7%). Higher number of retractions were reported in those journals with cites/doc <2.0-n = 49 (74.2%). The types of studies were mainly laboratory studies (34.7%), case reports (22.2%) and review articles (13.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The approach to ethical problems in papers published in dental scientific journals is still incipient; retractions were mostly due to the authors' malpractice and were more frequently related to journals with less impact.",

  "Abstract": "Abstract Retraction is a mechanism to correct scientific literature. This article aims to demonstrate that retractions have gradually increased, especially in the medical field. Methodologically, it is a literature review article whose statistical data were obtained from studies on retraction articles published in English between 2012 to 2017 in the PubMed and Google Scholar databases. Some of the most frequent causes of retraction found were plagiarism, misconduct, errors, fabrication and duplication. The highest incidence rate was reported in the United States, India, China, Japan and Germany. The highest retraction rate was for low-impact journals. The time for retraction is long but has decreased, which allows these articles to be cited and bad science to arise. It is concluded that uniformity is needed in notes and rules of retraction, retracted articles should be marked appropriately, and time for retraction must be reduced. In relation to bioethics, there is a serious problem in the integrity of scientific literature and a possible impact of retractions on the health of people.",

  "Abstract": "Academics are expected to publish their research work. Hence, during the past few years, the scientific community has witnessed an ever-increasing growth and output in scientific papers. However, a large number of authors have violated ethical norms of research leading to retractions of their research works as well. The article focuses on the scientific fraud emanating from China and India in Health Sciences for a period of three years i.e. 2015 to 2018. The present data were extracted from http://retractiondatabase.org/using a search filter term \"Research Articles OR Articles in Press\" on the subject category of Health Sciences (HSC). A total of 318 retracted papers were retrieved and the result of the study indicated that majority (268 items) of the retracted papers in Health Science originated from China, whereas just 50 retracted papers originated from India as on 21-02-2019. While analyzing the data, 26 redundant articles from China have been removed that received retraction notices. Further, the results of the study suggest that there are several factors associated with retraction of scientific papers, which include unreliable results, duplication of results, plagiarism, forged authorship, error in the text, error in data and so on.",

  "Abstract": "Aim: To investigate secular trends in article retractions in the oncology literature, particularly relating to cancer treatments and data available to patients. Methods: A bibliometric analysis of article retractions from PubMed in the period 2000-2018. Results: Analysis shows that article lifetime - that is the time period from initial publication to ultimate retraction - has decreased in recent years. It also shows that the retraction rate has also increased over the same period. Furthermore, over 20% of retracted oncology publications analyzed in this study relate to treatment-relevant topics such as clinical trials and studies in the anticancer properties of supplements. Conclusion: The causes and context of these trends are discussed and reference made to the dangers of scientific misconduct in oncology. © 2019 Pan Pantziarka.",

Search criteria PubMed uses the MeSH term ÔRetraction of PublicationÕ (MeSH Unique ID: D016440) to identify publications announcing the retraction of a publication (i.e., retraction notices). A retraction notice is included as an entry in the PubMed database, with similar data Þelds to a peer-reviewed journal article or other publication. Retracted articles are identiÞed using the MeSH term ÔRetracted PublicationÕ (MeSH Unique ID: D016441). Oncology publications, from all areas of cancer research, including preclinical and clinical studies, were included by using the search terms ÔneoplasmsÕ[MeSH Terms] OR ÔneoplasmsÕ[All Fields] OR ÔcancerÕ[All Fields]. Two queries were executed, one for retraction notices and one for articles. No restrictions were placed on time period and no other Þlters were applied, therefore yielding the Þnal search strings of: ÔRetraction of PublicationÕ [Publication Type] and (ÔneoplasmsÕ[MeSH Terms] OR ÔneoplasmsÕ[All Fields] OR ÔcancerÕ[All Fields]) ÔRetracted PublicationÕ [Publication Type] and (ÔneoplasmsÕ[MeSH Terms] OR ÔneoplasmsÕ[All Fields] OR ÔcancerÕ[All Fields])\"\n\"Authors The list of authors for each retracted article was also extracted and processed to correct for alternative forms (for example with and without middle initial, alternative hyphenation and so on).

These retracted papers were used as foundational texts by sophisticated fraudsters selling fake cures for cancer, autism and HIV [21]. One may note that while the courts have been active in closing down this sophisticated and dangerous operation, a number of papers by the fraudsters have yet to be retracted and remain in the literature despite legitimate concerns about the veracity of the claims made by the authors.[¬e]\"",

In line with previous studies, that data showed that users of CAM were more likely to have higher socio-economic status and to be better educated than nonusers. We may speculate that some of these patients are making treatment decisions based on misleading or inaccurate data, some of which may be sourced from scientiÞc publications. It is therefore some cause for concern that our study has identiÞed that over 20% of retracted oncology papers refer to publications relevant to treatment, including clinical trials and the use of supplements with anticancer properties. We also note that many of these treatment-relevant retractions have a higher citation rate than the average for retracted oncology papers.[¬e]\"",

  "Abstract": "Journal editors are among those who must face the issue of when and how to correct the scientific literature when an allegation or finding of scientific misconduct occurs. The author describes an instructive incident of tainted data and a subsequent allegation of misconduct that involved a federally-sponsored study where some data had been fabricated. The journals that had published or were considering articles from that study were not told about the problem for almost four years after the initial allegations of misconduct. The author then provides information to throw light on such questions as: Who has the responsibility to ensure that a manuscript that may contain falsified or fabricated data is not published? Who has the responsibility to correct the literature when falsified or fabricated data have been published, and at what point should that correction be made? For example, should it be when the problem of data is suspected or when it is proven? And if proven, proven by whom? How is the larger scientific community to be notified about the problem? Where and when should the correction or retraction appear, and what should it tell readers about the basis for the retraction or correction? She also presents data from 25 cases to show the various lengths of time involved in correcting the literature after allegations of research misconduct had been made. The author concludes that the record shows how disconnected journal editors have been from the scientific misconduct process and that expectations differ regarding the obligations of authors, research institutions, and federal agencies about informing a journal when an allegation of scientific misconduct is made about a publication in its pages. The 25 cases show that substantial delays in notifying the journal and the public about allegations and findings of scientific misconduct are endemic, and that all parties have far to go in appreciating their roles in maintaining the integrity of the biomedical literature.",

For journals to re- ceive rapid notification of a problem with an article, the cause of the problem (i.e., whether it is misconduct or not) will not be identified clearly. Early notification of the prob- lem and retraction of the article may explain why so many of the retractions associated with scientific misconduct do not adhere to the ICMJE standards that require clear notifica- tion that the article is being withdrawn because of an allega- tion of scientific misconduct. However, even in the cases in which the letter to the editor postdates the finding of mis- conduct, the letter typically does not indicate that miscon-\"\n\"duct has been found.45 Further, despite the IC]ME standards, many notices of correction are buried, e.g., on back pages of the journal, on unpaginated pages, or as letters to the editor.\"\n\"48 A\nletter submitted by the non-accused authors may attempt to\ndistance them from the accused author and attempt to lessen\ntheir being stigmatized by a finding of misconduct. Such a\nletter may state that the non-accused authors had no knowl-\nedge of the impropriety.49\"\n\"In short, the Poisson incident and Fisher case brought atten-\ntion to how disconnected journal editors have been from the\nscientific misconduct process and also demonstrated that\nthere are different expectations regarding the obligations of\nauthors, research institutions, and federal agencies about in-\nforming the relevant journals when an allegation of scien-\ntific misconduct is made about a publication in its pages.\nThe 25 cases reviewed in Table 1 show that substantial de-\nlays are endemic in notifying the journal and the public\nabout allegations and findings of scientific misconduct. The\nevidence also suggests that all parties have far to go in appre-\nciating their roles in maintaining the integrity of the bio-\nmedical literature.[¬e]\"",

  "Abstract": "The author analyzes retracted biomedical literature to determine if open access and fee-for-access works differ in terms of the practice and effectiveness of retrac-tion. Citation and content analysis were applied to articles grouped by accessibility (libre, gratis, and fee for access) for various bibliometric attributes. Open access literature does not differ from fee-for-access lit-erature in terms of impact factor, detection of error, or change in postretraction citation rates. Literature found in the PubMed Central Open Access subset provides detailed information about the nature of the anomaly more often than less accessible works. Open access literature appears to be of similar reliability and integrity as the population of biomedical literature in general, with the added value of being more forthcoming about the nature of errors when they are identified.",

  "Abstract": "Little is known about the ultimate scientific fate of retracted, invalid literature. We identified 82 completely retracted articles by electronic and manual methods and measured their subsequent use in the scientific literature by performing citation analysis. After retraction, these studies were cited, for support of scientific concepts, 733 times. Comparison with a control group revealed that retraction reduces subsequent citation by approximately 35%. There was no evidence that small, obscure journals, non-US journals, or non-US authors were disproportionately responsible for these citations. Although, after retraction, US authors accounted for a smaller percentage of citations, they continued to be the single greatest source. Several possible reasons why invalid information continues to be used were identified. These included a dearth of available information on retracted works; inconsistency in retraction format, terminology, and indexing; and an apparent lack of sufficient attention to manuscripts by some authors and editors.",

  "Abstract": "In 1989-90 the authors conducted a nationwide study to examine how academic medical libraries handled articles that report invalid science and to determine the effectiveness of any policies implemented to limit the use of such articles. Ninety-five of the 127 medical school libraries the authors surveyed completed questionnaires analyzing policy and attitude issues. Eighty-four of these libraries manually reviewed the available copies they held of ten retracted articles. Of the 811 copies of the retracted, invalid articles reviewed, 742 (91.5%) were not tagged as being invalid. Seventy-nine percent of the libraries had tagged none of the retracted studies and only 16% had policies for managing articles that report invalid science. Academic librarians reflected a common attitude against perceived library censorship and emphasized the user's role in assuring validity. The nation's medical libraries, at least in part by intent, do not commonly identify or have policies to handle the invalid articles they hold. The authors conclude that biomedical researchers, clinicians, and teachers should not assume published studies held in libraries are inherently valid. The lack of stated policy and the disparate assumptions about the role libraries play in this area may perpetuate the use of invalid articles.",

          "Text": "Page 4:\n[¬s]\"n the face of these findings what recommendations can be made to limit the continued use of invalid science? We offer the following: 1. Medical school libraries should indicate their policies for handling in- 112 accurate material and, likewise, users should make themselves well aware of these policies. The specific policy adopted may be less important than eliminating the false assumption by some users that libraries uniformly identify invalid work. 2. Currently, users alone are held responsible for determining a study's validity. Because inaccuracy is often not identified until years after publi­ cation,222 clinicians , researchers, and educators should periodically review MEDLINE's citations of the studies they use, even those held in personal files for years. While this aspect of re-reviewing work previously ac­ cepted as valid may seem impractical, other accurate methods are not avail­ able at this time. The increasingly used CD-ROM technologies will also successfully identify retractions, comments , and errata, although there is some delay involved in awaiting the periodic disc updates for previous years. 3. Academic libraries choosing a hands-off policy regarding the integ ­ rity of their holdings should continue to work aggressively to educate users that only electronic searches will identify important retractions or corrections. 4. Given the inevitably expanding body of invalid results (caused by fraud or honest error), the broader question of how information should be removed from the scientific com­ munity needs to be addressed by orga­ nizations of bioscience, library science, and academia. Past emphasis has been placed only on how to get new information into scientists' hands.\"\n\"The individuals and institutions of science will be well served by efforts to limit readers' use of invalid study results and to pro­ mote self-correction of such results by the scientific community.[¬e]\"",

  "Abstract": "A faked peer review is a novel cause for retraction. We reviewed the characteristics of papers retracted due to a faked peer review. All papers retracted due to faked peer reviews were identified by searching the Retraction Watch website and by conducting a manual search. All identified papers were confirmed in published journals. The information of retracted papers was collected, which primarily included publisher, journal, journal impact factor, country, as well as publication and retraction year. Overall, 250 retracted papers were identified. They were published in 48 journals by six publishers. The top 5 journals included the Journal of Vibration and Control (24.8%), Molecular Biology Reports (11.6%), Immunopharmacology and Immunotoxicology (8.0%), Tumour Biology (6.8%) and European Journal of Medical Research (6.4%). The publishers included SAGE (31%), Springer (26%), BioMed Central (18%), Elsevier (13%), Informa (11%) and LWW (1%). A minority (4%) of retracted papers were published in Science Citation Index (SCI) journals with an impact factor of >5. A majority (74.8%) of retracted papers were written by Chinese researchers. In terms of the publication year, the retracted papers were published since 2010, and the number of retracted papers peaked in 2014 (40.8%). In terms of the retraction year, the retractions started in 2012, and the number of retractions peaked in 2015 (59.6%). The number of papers retracted due to faked peer reviews differs largely among journals and countries. With the improvement of the peer review mechanism and increased education about publishing ethics, such academic misconduct may gradually disappear in future.",

  "Abstract": "Purpose: Although retractions are commonly considered to be negative, the fact remains that they play a positive role in the academic community. For instance, retractions help scientific enterprise perform its self-correcting function and provide lessons for future researchers; furthermore, they represent the fulfillment of social responsibilities, and they enable scientific communities to offer better monitoring services to keep problematic studies in check. This study aims to provide a thorough overview of the practice of retraction in scientific publishing from the first incident to the present. Methods: We built a database using SQL Server 2016 and homemade artificial intelligence tools to extract and classify data sources including RetractionWatch, official publishers' archives, and online communities into ready-to-analyze groups and to scan them for new data. After data cleaning, a dataset of 18,603 retractions from 1,753 (when the first retracted paper was published) to February 2019, covering 127 research fields, was established. Results: Notable retraction events include the rise in retracted articles starting in 1999 and the unusual number of retractions in 2010. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Elsevier, and Springer account for nearly 60% of all retracted papers globally, with Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers contributing the most retractions, even though it is not the organization that publishes the most journals. Finally, reasons for retraction are diverse but the most common is \"fake peer review\". Conclusion: This study suggests that the frequency of retraction has boomed in the past 20 years, and it underscores the importance of understanding and learning from the practice of retracting scientific articles.",

  "Abstract": "Background: In October 2004, a flawed systematic review entitled \"Interactive Health Communication Applications for People with Chronic Disease\" was published in the Cochrane Library, accompanied by several press releases in which authors warned the public of the negative health consequences of interactive health communication applications, including the Internet. Within days of the review's publication, scientists identified major coding errors and other methodological problems that invalidated the principal conclusions of the study and led to a retraction. While the original study results and their negative conclusions were widely publicized in the media, the retraction seemed to go unnoticed. Objective: This paper aims to document an unprecedented case of misinformation from a Cochrane review and its impact on media, scientists, and patients. As well, it aims to identify the generic factors leading to the incident and suggest remedies. Methods: This was a qualitative study of the events leading to the retraction of the publication and of the reactions from media, scientists, and patients. This includes a review and content analysis of academic and mass media articles responding to the publication and retraction. Mass media articles were retrieved in May 2005 from LexisNexis Academic and Google and were classified and tallied. The extended case method is employed, and the analysis is also applied to comparable publishing events. Results: A search on LexisNexis Academic database with the query \"Elizabeth Murray AND health\" for the period of June 2004 to May 2005 revealed a total of 15 press reports, of which only 1 addressed the retraction. Google was searched for references to the review, and the first 200 retrieved hits were analyzed. Of these, 170 pages were not related to the review. Of the remaining 30 pages, 23 (77%) were reports about the original publication that did not mention the retraction, 1 (3%) was a bibliography not mentioning the retraction, and 6 (20%) addressed the retraction, of which only 1 was a non-Cochrane-related source. Conclusions: Analyzed retrievals showed that the mass media gave more coverage to the Cochrane review than to the retraction or to a related systematic review with a similar scope but a different conclusion. Questionable results were prematurely disseminated, oversimplified, and sensationalized, while the retraction was hardly noticed by the public. Open commentary by scientists and patients helped to rapidly identify the errors but did not prevent or correct the dissemination of misinformation.",

In contrast, only 6 pages (20%) addressed the retraction: 2 were the original press releases now marked with “retraction” but still emphasizing in their particulars the negative health impact, 3 were Web pages at Cochrane sites, and 1 was an announcement from MedicalNews entitled “Updated press release to October 2004 Cochrane Review.” The latter was the only non-Cochrane–related page primarily addressing the retraction.\"\n\"A search on LexisNexis with the query “Brewster AND antihypertensive” for the period November 2004 to May 2005 retrieved no articles in either the “General News–Major Papers” category or the “Medical and Health News” category. A search on Google for “Brewster antihypertensive” followed by an examination of the first 100 retrieved pages identified 23 relevant pages, which had a very different content pattern than the hits for the IHCA review. They all contained citations of papers from Brewster et al, who have published elsewhere on the same subject as in their review. The Brewster et al publication attracting the most attention was an article [19] in the Annals of Internal Medicine that was not retracted but has the same title as the Cochrane review. Thus, the only other retracted Cochrane review had a very different mass media, scientific, and web impact than the IHCA review.\"\n\"A search on LexisNexis Academic with the query “McKinley and surgical and Internet” for the period 1995 to May 2005 revealed no relevant press reports, neither in the “General News–Major Papers” category (three hits were all not relevant to the McKinley article) or in the “Medical and Health News” category.\"\n\"A search on Google for English pages with the query “McKinley surgical Internet” revealed 96 irrelevant pointers in the first 100[¬e]\"",

  "Abstract": "Objectives: To explore how often newspapers cover the retraction of a medical journal article and whether newspaper coverage corresponds with the appearance of a press release about the retraction. Methods: Fifty citations were identified in PubMed that had been indexed with the Medical Subject Heading 'Retracted Publication'. Next, the archives of LexisNexis's 'Major Newspapers' and EurekAlert's press releases were searched to find references to those retracted publications. Results: Newspaper articles addressed exactly three of the 50 retracted publications, and press releases, exactly four of the 50 retracted publications. All three retracted publications that received newspaper coverage also had a press release. In other words, newspapers only covered a retraction that had been introduced by a press release. Conclusion: One would expect that newspaper coverage would increase after a press release, but the suggested relationships among a medical journal article retraction, a press release and newspaper coverage should be further investigated. If the linkage suggested by the data of this study holds, and if newspaper coverage stimulates library patron interest, then a medical library might prepare itself for information requests following a press release.",

The purpose of our study was to assess the prevalence, characteristics, and trends of retracted publications in the field of orthopaedics. METHODS: Five databases were utilized to identify retracted publications in orthopaedics. The cited articles were assessed for various characteristics, including reason for retraction, based on the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) guidelines and trends over time. RESULTS: From 1984 to June 4, 2016, 59 of 229,502 orthopaedic publications were retracted (3 per 10,000 articles). There was a spike in the prevalence (22 of 59) of retracted articles in 2015. When compared with the total number of retracted publications identified through PubMed, the field of orthopaedics represented 1.4% of all retracted publications. The original version of 47 of these 59 retracted publications was still available on the respective journal's web site; 14 (30%) of these were not noted as having been retracted. The mean time from electronic publication to retraction was 19.4 +/- 23.3 months. The mean number of citations of a retracted publication after the date of retraction was 9.3 +/- 19.3. Reasons for retraction included plagiarism (32%), misconduct (27%), redundant publication (22%), miscalculation or experimental error (8%), and unethical research (0%); the reason for retraction was not stated for 10% of the publications. There was no correlation between a journal's impact factor and the mean number of months to retraction (p = 0.564). CONCLUSIONS: While uncommon, the retraction of publications within the field of orthopaedics may be increasing. The most often cited reasons for retraction were plagiarism, misconduct, and redundant publication. Retracted articles continue to be cited in the literature after retraction. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Greater awareness of the COPE guidelines within the orthopaedic community and more efficient means to prevent the citation of retracted articles are needed.",

  "Abstract": "Objectives The present systematic review aimed to perform an in-depth analysis of the different features of retracted publications in the dental field. Material and methods This review has been recorded in the PROSPERO database (CRD42017075634). Two independent reviewers performed an electronic search (Pubmed, Retraction Watch) for retracted articles in dental literature up to December 31, 2018. Results 180 retracted papers were identified, the first published in 2001. Retractions increased by 47% in the last four-year period (2014-2018), when compared with 2009-2013 (94 and 64 retracted publications, respectively). Author misconduct was the most common reason for retraction (65.0%), followed by honest scientific errors (12.2%) and publisher-related issues (10.6%). The majority of retracted research was conducted in Asia (55.6%), with 49 papers written in India (27.2%). 552 researchers (89%) are listed as authors in only one retracted article, while 10 researchers (1.6%) are present in five or more retracted publications. Retracted articles were cited 530 times after retraction: the great majority of these citations (89.6%) did not consider the existence of the retraction notice and treated data from retracted articles as reliable. Conclusions Retractions in dental literature have constantly increased in recent years, with the majority of them due to misconduct and fraud. The publication of unreliable research has many negative consequences. Studies derived from such material are designed on potentially incorrect bases, waste funds and resources, and most importantly, increase risk of incorrect treatment for patients. Citation of retracted papers represents a major issue for the scientific community.",

  "Abstract": "This study provides current data on key questions about retraction of scientific articles. Findings confirm that the rate of retractions remains low but is increasing. The most commonly cited reason for retraction was research error or inability to reproduce results; the rate from research misconduct is an underestimate, since some retractions necessitated by research misconduct were reported as being due to inability to reproduce. Retraction by parties other than authors is increasing, especially for research misconduct. Although retractions are on average occurring sooner after publication than in the past, citation analysis shows that they are not being recognised by subsequent users of the work. Findings suggest that editors and institutional officials are taking more responsibility for correcting the scientific record but that reasons published in the retraction notice are not always reliable. More aggressive means of notification to the scientific community appear to be necessary.",

  "Abstract": "We examined all 208 closed cases involving official findings of research misconduct published by the US Office of Research Integrity from 1992 to 2011 to determine how often scientists mention in a retraction or correction notice that there was an ethical problem with an associated article. 75 of these cases cited at least one published article affected by misconduct for a total of 174 articles. For 127 of these 174, we found both the article and a retraction or correction statement. Since eight of the 127 published statements consisted of simply the word 'retracted,' our analysis focused on the remaining 119 for which a more detailed retraction or correction was published. Of these 119 statements, only 41.2% mentioned ethics at all (and only 32.8% named a specific ethical problem such as fabrication, falsification or plagiarism), whereas the other 58.8% described the reason for retraction or correction as error, loss of data or replication failure when misconduct was actually at issue. Among the published statements in response to an official finding of misconduct (within the time frame studied), the proportion that mentioned ethics was significantly higher in recent years than in earlier years, as was the proportion that named a specific problem. To promote research integrity, scientific journals should consider adopting policies concerning retractions and corrections similar to the guidelines developed by the Committee on Publication Ethics. Funding agencies and institutions should take steps to ensure that articles affected by misconduct are retracted or corrected.",

The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) has developed extensive guidelines for retractions and corrections, which can serve as a model for journal policies\"\n\" COPE recom­ mends that editors should consider retracting articles when there is clear evidence that the findings are unreliable due to misconduct or honest error. Editors may also retract articles that have been published previously. Corrections are appropri­ ate when only a small portion of an otherwise reliable publica­ tion is misleading. Retraction notices should be freely available, published promptly in electronic and print versions, and elec­ tronically linked to the retracted article. Retraction notices should state who is retracting the article and why (eg, for mis­ conduct or error). Journal editors may retract articles even if some or all of the authors do not agree to the retraction. 13\"\n\"Although only journals have the authority to retract or correct articles, we also encourage funding agencies and institu­ tions to take steps to ensure that articles affected by miscon­ duct are retracted or corrected. ORI could take legal action against researchers who do not honour an agreement to retract or correct an article associated with an official finding of mis­ conduct. If an individual has been debarred for 5 years, ORI could make debarment indefinite if the individual does not make a good faith effort to honour the agreement. Institutions that make findings of misconduct could also require employees to retract or correct articles. If an employee refuses to meet such requirements, the institution could terminate his or her employment. ORI and institutions could also inform the journal that an article is associated with misconduct, if the authors do not retract it.\"\n\"one could argue that authors should fully explain why an\narticle is being retracted or corrected, especially when miscon-\nduct by at least one of the authors is involved. Honesty and\ntransparency require scientists to tell the whole truth when\nretracting or correcting an article, so that others can evaluate\ntheir work and decide whether parts of the research unaffected\nby misconduct can be trusted and whether any of the coau-\nthors are at fault.2 11[¬e]\"",

  "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study gathered information about the retraction policies of the top 200 scientific journals, ranked by impact factor. METHODS: Editors of the top 200 science journals for the year 2012 were contacted by email. RESULTS: One hundred forty-seven journals (74%) responded to a request for information. Of these, 95 (65%) had a retraction policy. Of journals with a retraction policy, 94% had a policy that allows the editors to retract articles without authors' consent. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of journals in this sample had a retraction policy, and almost all of them would retract an article without the authors' permission.",

Because impact factor was not normally distributed, we used a Mann-Whitney test to compare impact factor between journals with a policy and those without. We used a chi-square test to determine whether there was an association between impact factor quartile and policy status. To determine whether there was a possible response bias, we used Mann-Whitney tests to compare responding and nonresponding journals with regard to impact factor, and chi-square tests or Fishers exact test to compare responding and nonresponding journals with regard to review journal status and discipline of the journal.

Review journals tend to have higher impact factors than other journals because review articles are read and cited more frequently than other types of article. Therefore, review journals are over- represented among those with the highest impact factors [15]. Another potential bias is that our study focused on high-impact journals, so the results might not generalize to low-impact journals. To address these potential biases, it would be useful to conduct another study of journal retraction policies that includes more non-review journals and journals with lower impact factors.\"\n\"However, both of these claims\nare speculative, and further research, such as inter-\nviews with editors, is needed to understand the\nfactors that influence the retraction rate and retraction\npolicy development.\"\n\"However, this hypothesis is speculative, and\nmore research is needed on why journals have or have\nnot adopted retracted policies.[¬e]\"",

  "Abstract": "The research output of countries is among the indicators that help us understand the dynamics of science. Increasingly, these dynamics have been marked by changes in scientific communication. Researchers' attitudes toward open science, alternative models of publication and toward originality are among the elements shaping the current scientific landscape. This changing panorama reflects on the attitude of authors, editors and publishers toward the correction of the literature, a practice that is encountered to different extents in different fields. This practice may suggest, among several issues, commitment of the scientific community to boosting the reliability of the research record. Would the research output of countries have any association with this panorama? We analyzed 1623 retractions issued in 2013-2015 and discussed in Retraction Watch (RW), www.retractionwatch.com. These retractions account for a considerable fraction of the total of retraction notices in PubMed in the same period. They were categorized by reason, field and country (that of the corresponding author). These retractions were distributed among 71 countries, with 15 countries accounting for a major share (85%)-most of those with the largest number of publications in the Scimago Journal & Country Rank (SJR). However, there is no consistent pattern for the relationship between ranking in SJR and ranking in number of retractions across countries in our RW dataset, which is skewed mostly by the fact that the RW website tends to post newsworthy retractions, with a bias toward biomedical and clinical sciences. This caveat notwithstanding, the prevalence of the most productive countries in our dataset of retractions is worth noting. Gradually, retractions have been permeating the dynamics of research productivity in many countries but, so far, there is limited knowledge of this interaction. We believe it should be further explored.",

The United States also accounts for the highest number of retractions for misconduct (n = 255), followed by Japan (n = 75) and India (n = 61) (Fig. 5).\"\n\"For Japan, however, we should note that only two authors, Shigeaki Kato and Yoshitaka Fujii, accounted for a considerable number of retractions (28 and 20, respectively) in the period, which led to 48% of total retractions for this country.\"\n\"Fig. 5 Reasons for full retractions (n = 1373) discussed on the RW website in the 20132015 period: United States (n = 376; error = 56; misconduct = 255; other = 194; unclear = 16); China (n = 283; error = 24; misconduct = 55; other = 202; unclear = 6); Japan (n = 101; error = 6; misconduct = 75; other = 21; unclear = 0); India (n = 96; error = 8; misconduct = 61; other = 26; unclear = 2); Taiwan (n = 82; error = 2; misconduct = 11; other = 71; unclear = 0); Iran (n = 66; error = 1; miscon- duct = 25; other = 43; unclear = 1); Italy (n = 66; error = 2; misconduct = 41; other = 10; unclear = 4); Netherlands (n = 55; error = 5; misconduct = 46; other = 5; unclear = 0); Germany (n = 50; error = 7; misconduct = 12; other = 29; unclear = 3); South Korea (n = 49; error = 6; misconduct = 13; other = 31; unclear = 1); United Kingdom (n = 44; error = 12; misconduct = 22; other = 10; unclear = 0); Australia (n = 27; error = 4; misconduct = 10; other = 12; unclear = 2); France (n = 27; error = 7; misconduct = 15; other = 4; unclear = 1); Canada (n = 26; error = 2; misconduct = 19; other = 6; unclear = 0); Spain (n = 25; error = 6; misconduct = 8; other = 11; unclear = 1)[¬e]\"",

As can be seen, India (n = 37) and Iran (n = 24) have the highest prevalence of plagiarism in the period, accounting for 39 and 36% of their total number of retractions. A previous study (Amos 2014) also found higher percentages of retractions attributed to plagiarism for India (36.7%), Iran (42.9%) and Italy (66.7%) when looking for PubMed retractions in the 20082012 period. Citron and Ginsparg (2014), however, found much lower rates of plagiarism for India and China. Nonetheless, the focus was on submissions related to the preprint server ArXiv, which mostly publishes in physics and mathematical \u001eelds (Bohannon 2014).\"\n\"When we look at a possible relationship between the research output of each country and its number of retractions (Table 1) in this three-year period, we \u001end that some countries with the highest research output in 2015United States and China, for exam- ple are associated with the highest number of retractions. But, as can be seen in Table 1, there is no consistent pattern.\"\n\"Concerning the US, the country leads most \u001eelds in the Scimago ranking (2015), with an important fraction of its papers published in high-impact factor journals. As they are responsible for the greatest fraction of top-tier publications, clearer policies for issuing retractions are expected (Fang and Casadevall 2011) in these journals. Mapping retraction cases across different countries, He (2013) found that the US had the highest number of publications and retractions, though its index for retraction activity was within the world average level.\"\n\"Fig. 6 Percentage of full retractions attributed to plagiarism discussed on the RW website in the 20132015 period: United States (n = 376; plagiarism = 29; 8%); China (n = 283; plagiarism = 32; 11%); Japan (n = 101; plagiarism = 2; 2%); India (n = 96; plagiarism = 37; 39%); Taiwan (n = 82; plagiarism = 9; 11%); Iran (n = 66; plagiarism = 24; 36%); Italy (n = 66; plagiarism = 21; 32%); Netherlands (n = 55; plagiarism = 6; 11%); Germany (n = 50; plagiarism = 0); South Korea (n = 49; plagiarism = 5; 10%); United Kingdom (n = 44; plagiarism = 6; 14%); Australia (n = 27; plagiarism = 3; 11%); France (n = 27; plagiarism = 7; 26%); Canada (n = 26; plagiarism = 1; 4%); Spain (n = 25; plagiarism = 2; 8%)[¬e]\"",

  "Abstract": "This paper (work-in-progress) provides preliminary results from an analysis of papers with the word \"retracted \" in their titles in a 20-year period. There were 5566 such papers, averaging 0.02% of all Web of Science documents, but with an anomalous peak in 2011 caused by the retraction of a set of conference proceedings from Singapore. More than half the other retracted papers were in clinical medicine or biomedical research, so their original publication may have caused harm to patients. The countries with the highest percentages of retractions (other than in these conference proceedings) were Iran, Pakistan, Egypt, Algeria and Saudi Arabia, all Muslimmajority countries. Future work will examine the possible reasons for retraction in these countries.",

  "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to characterize trends related to retracted publications within radiology journals. MATERIALS AND METHODS. PubMed was queried to identify all articles with the publication type \"retracted publication\" or \"notification of retraction.\" Articles published within radiology journals were identified using Journal Citation Reports' journal categories. Available versions of original articles and publication notices were accessed from journal websites. Citations to retracted publications were identified using Web of Science. Overall trends were assessed. RESULTS. Forty-eight retracted original research articles were identified within radiology journals since 1983, which included 1.1% of all PubMed \"retracted publication\" entries. Distinct PubMed entries were available for the retracted publication and retraction notification in 39 of 48 articles. The original PDF was available for 37 articles, although the articles were not watermarked as retracted in 23 cases. In six cases with a watermarked PDF, further searches identified nonwatermarked versions. Original HTML versions were available for 13 articles but 11 were not watermarked. The mean (+/- SD) delay between publication and retraction was 2.7 +/- 2.8 years (range, 0-16 years). The mean number of citations to retracted articles was 10.9 +/- 17.1 (range, 0-94 citations). Reasons for retraction included problematic or incorrect methods or results (although it typically was unclear whether these represented honest errors or misconduct) in 33.3% of cases, complete or partial duplicate publication in 33.3% of cases, plagiarism in 14.6% of cases, a permission issue in 8.3% of cases, the publisher's error in 6.3% of cases, and no identified reason in 6.3% of cases. One or no retractions occurred annually from 1986 to 2001, although two or more retractions occurred annually in nine of the 12 years from 2002 through 2013. CONCLUSION. Retraction represents an uncommon, yet potentially increasing, issue within radiology journals that publishers have inconsistently and insufficiently addressed. Greater awareness and training in proper biomedical research conduct, as well as establishment and enforcement of standardized publishers' policies, are warranted.",

  "Abstract": "The objective of this study is to compare the quantity of citations that retracted and nonretracted articles received in engineering based on articles indexed in the Web of Science database and published between 1945 and 2015. For data analysis, the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences was used along with the Kolmogorov?Smirnov, Mann?Whitney, Tukey?Kramer tests and descriptive statistics. The data set included 238 retracted and 236 nonretracted articles, with the retracted articles cited 2,348 times and nonretracted articles cited 2,957 times. The results highlight that retraction does not end citation, thus threatening scientific credibility.",

According to Fávero, Belfiore, Silva, and Chan (2009), the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is an adhesion test that compares the frequency distribution of a set of observed sample values with the expected or theoretical distribution (p. 112). For Field (2009)\"\n\"To verify significant differences in the means between citations and self-citations for the retracted and nonretracted articles, the nonparametric MannWhitney test was performed. According to Fávero et al. (2009, p. 176), this test is applied when the assumption of normality is not met. We assumed that if p < .05, there was difference between groups, and if p > .05, there was no difference between groups.[¬e]\"",

On the other hand, we identified articles that did not even remain 1 year in the current literature. On average, the life span of an article is approximately five years. As no similar studies were found that quantify the density of the studied articles, we compared the data with studies that assessed the obsolescence of the literature used, or the references employed. Along these lines, the analysis by Pao (1989) demonstrates that in the field of chemistry, article obsolescence occurs in less than 8 years after publication, whereas in the area of mathematics, obsolescence occurs at about 20 years. Borba, Hoeltgebaum, and Silveira (2011), in their study presented at the Academy of Management Meeting on the field of entrepreneurship between 1954 and 2005, found that the obsolescence of the cited literature was 11 years. Meanwhile, Freitas (1997), studying the journal Transinformação and the area of communication and information sciences, found that the average length of time literature was used was 10 years.\"\n\"Comparing the aforementioned studies with the field of engineering, the focus of the current study, we can see that the average of the studied area is recent.[¬e]\"",

  "Abstract": "This study assesses the retractions of scientific articles in engineering journals indexed on the Web of Science from 1945 to 2015. The data set was built based on documents containing the keywords retracted, retraction, withdrawal, or redress. We used database exploration techniques, including Structured Query Language and analysis of variance, for data analysis. We analyzed 238 retractions published by 117 journals. The most common reason for retraction was unethical research, and higher impact factors journals tended to publish more retractions. In conclusion, most of the analyzed retractions were the result of unethical research and were retracted by editors.",

  "Abstract": "Background and Aims: Various aspects of retracted articles authored by Yoshitaka Fujii and their retraction notices have been examined. Yuhji Saitoh has coauthored many articles with Yoshitaka Fujii which were subsequently retracted. Japanese Society of Anesthesiology (JSA) recommends retraction of various articles by Yuhji Saitoh, but various attributes of those and their retraction notices have not been examined. Methods: A list of retracted articles was retrieved from PubMed, Retraction Watch Database and relevant journals. Their retraction notices were obtained from the journal's webpage. Predefined characteristics of the retracted articles and their retraction notices were evaluated against those proposed by Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). Results: Fifteen such articles were retracted. Two of them were not identified as retracted in the journal webpage. Half of the papers mentioned by JSA are yet to be retracted. Among those retracted, only 13.3% retraction notices were in line with the guidelines published by the COPE. Two retracted articles are yet to be flagged as retracted in PubMed. The median (interquartile range) time required for retraction from the date of declaration of being eligible for retraction is 14 (3) months. Data were analysed with Microsoft Excel™ (2007). Conclusion: Even after more than 1 year of recommendation, many articles containing evidence of scientific misconduct are yet to be retracted. Among those retracted, the relevant authority failed to follow the prevalent and well-regarded standards of ethics in scholarly publication. © 2019 Indian Journal of Anaesthesia | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",

  "Abstract": "Recent studies have suggested an increase in the number of retracted scientific publications. It is unclear how broadly the issue of misleading and fraudulent publications pertains to retractions of drug therapy studies. Therefore, we sought to determine the trends and factors associated with retracted publications in drug therapy literature. A PubMed search was conducted to identify retracted drug therapy articles published from 2000-2011. Articles were grouped according to reason for retraction, which was classified as scientific misconduct or error. Scientific misconduct was further divided into data fabrication, data falsification, questions of data veracity, unethical author conduct, and plagiarism. Error was defined as duplicate publication, scientific mistake, journal error, or unstated reasons. Additional data were extracted from the retracted articles, including type of article, funding source, author information, therapeutic area, and retraction issue. A total of 742 retractions were identified from 2000-2011 in the general biomedical literature, and 102 drug studies met our inclusion criteria. Of these, 73 articles (72%) were retracted for a reason classified as scientific misconduct, whereas 29 articles (28%) were retracted for error. Among the 73 articles classified as scientific misconduct, those classified as unethical author conduct (32 articles [44%]) and data fabrication (24 articles [33%]) constituted the majority. The median time from publication of the original article to retraction was 31 months (range 1-130). Fifty percent of retracted articles did not state a funding source, whereas pharmaceutical manufacturer funding accounted for only 13 articles (13%) analyzed. Many retractions were due to repeat offenses by a small number of authors, with nearly 40% of the retracted studies associated with two individuals. We found that a greater proportion of drug therapy articles were retracted for reasons of misconduct and fraud compared with other biomedical studies. It is important for health care practitioners to monitor the literature for retractions so that recommendations for drug therapy and patient management may be modified accordingly.",

  "Abstract": "Research on scientific misconduct relies increasingly on retractions of articles. An interdisciplinary line of research has been established that empirically assesses the phenomenon of scientific misconduct using information on retractions, and thus aims to shed light on aspects of misconduct that previously were hidden. However, comparability and interpretability of studies are to a certain extent impeded by an absence of standards in corpus delineation and by the fact that the validity of this empirical data basis has never been systematically scrutinized. This article assesses the conceptual and empirical delineation of retractions against related publication types through a comparative analysis of the coverage and consistency of retraction annotation in the databases PubMed and the Web of Science (WoS), which are both commonly used for empicial studies on retractions. The searching and linking approaches of the WoS were subsequently evaluated. The results indicate that a considerable number of PubMed retracted publications and retractions are not labeled as such in the WoS or are indistinguishable from corrections, which is highly relevant for corpus and sample strategies in the WoS.",

The PubMed indexed journals considered are Indian Journal of Dental research, Journal of Indian Society of Periodontology, Contemporary Clinical Dentistry, Journal of Indian Society of Pedodontics and Preventive Dentistry, Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology and Journal of Indian Prosthodontic Society for type of article, name of dental specialty, topic of individual dental specialties, causes for retraction of article and authorship trend of retracted articles using web-based search. Among PubMed indexed Indian dental journals,the number of retracted articles were as follows: Indian Journal of Dental research (4) followed by Journal of Indian Society of Periodontology (3), Contemporary Clinical Dentistry (3), Journal of Indian Society of Pedodontics and Preventive Dentistry (2), Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology (2) and Journal of Indian Prosthodontic Society (1). Out of 15 retracted articles from PubMed indexed Indian dental journals, case reports (7) form a major share followed by original articles(6) and review articles (2). Among the dental specialties of retracted articles, oral pathology and microbiology (5) constitute the major share followed by periodontics (4), pedodontics (4), oral medicine and radiology (1) and prosthodontics (1). Duplicate publication (7), plagiarism (5) and authorship dispute (3) are the causes for the retraction of article.",

  "Abstract": "In the battle for better science, the research community must obliterate, at times, works from the publication record, a process known as retraction. Additionally, publications and papers accumulate an altmetric attention score, which is a complementary metric to citation-based metrics. We used the citations, Journal Impact Factor, time between publication and retraction and the reasons behind retraction in order to find determinants of the retracted papers altmetric attention score. To find these determinants we compared two samples, one of retractions with top altmetric attention scores and one of retractions with altmetric attention scores chosen at random. We used a binary choice model to estimate the probability of being retracted due to misconduct or error. The model shows positive effects of altmetric scores and the time between publication and retraction on the probability to be retracted due to misconduct in the top sample. We conclude that there is an association between retraction due to misconduct and higher altmetric attention scores within the top sample.",

The “influenced by a third party” category included four articles, the “other” cate- gory two articles and the “unclear” category four retrac- tions (Fig. 3).\"\n\"73 percent of all observations in the random sample were retracted because of misconduct as the main reason. However, only half of all retractions in the top sample were retracted due to misconduct. The results of a chi- squared test for categorical data rejects the null hypoth- esis of independence (χ 2 =14.84, df = 4, p = 0.005), thus the different distribution of reasons between the two sam- ples depends on the sample itself.\"\n\"We have not found any dependencies within the random sample between the altmetric attention scores and the probability of retracting a publication due to misconduct (Tab. 5). Even though there was a large percentage of re- traction due to misconduct in the random sample, none of the variables are associated with the reason of retrac- tion. When we exclude the “Journal Impact Factor” in our second regression, the number of citations is signifi- cant on the p = 10 percent level. Surprisingly, the effect’s sign is negative. If the number of citations has any influ- ence on our model in this sample, then an increase of citations means a lower probability of being retracted due to misconduct.[¬e]\"",

  "Abstract": "During the past few decades, the rate of publication retractions has increased dramatically in academia. In this study, we investigate retractions from a quantitative perspective, aiming to answer two fundamental ques-tions. One, how do retractions influence the scholarly impact of retracted papers, authors, and institutions? Two, does this influence propagate to the wider academ-ic community through scholarly associations? Specifi-cally, we analyzed a set of retracted articles indexed in Thomson Reuters Web of Science (WoS), and ran multi-ple experiments to compare changes in scholarly impact against a control set of nonretracted articles, authors, and institutions. We further applied the Granger Causality test to investigate whether different scientific topics are dynamically affected by retracted papers occurring within those topics. Our results show two key findings: first, the scholarly impact of retracted papers and authors significantly decreases after retrac-tion, and the most severe impact decrease correlates with retractions based on proven, purposeful scientific misconduct; second, this retraction penalty does not seem to spread through the broader scholarly social graph, but instead has a limited and localized effect. Our findings may provide useful insights for scholars or sci-ence committees to evaluate the scholarly value of papers, authors, or institutions related to retractions.",

  "Abstract": "We examine the number of citations in 10 highly cited retracted papers, and compare their current pre- and post-citation values. We offer some possible explanations for the continued citation of these retracted papers, and point out some of the risks that may be involved for the communities that continue to cite them. In general, retracted papers should not be cited, but often there is fault with unclear publisher web-sites, the existence of pirate web-sites or sites that display copies of the unretracted version of the paper, or even the insistent citation of a retracted paper because the results remain valid, or because the authors (most likely) refuse to accept the retracted status of that paper, or continue to believe that the core findings of the study remain valid.",

  "Abstract": "Science is a dynamic subject and it was never free of misconduct or bad research. Indeed, the scientific method itself is intended to overcome mistakes and misdeeds. So, we aimed to assess various factors associated with retraction of scientific articles from 2004 to 2013. Data were retrieved from PubMed and Medline using the keywords retraction of articles, retraction notice, and withdrawal of article in April 2014 to detect articles retracted from 2004 to 2013. Statistical analysis was carried out using t-test and Karl Pearson's correlation coefficient. Results showed that a total of 2343 articles were retracted between 2004 and 2013, and original articles followed by case reports constituted major part of it. Time interval between submission and retraction of article has reduced in recent times. Impact factor and retraction do not have any significant correlation. We conclude that although retraction of articles is a rare event, its constant rise in scientific literature is quite worrisome. It is still unclear whether misconduct/mistakes in articles are increasing hastily or the articles are retracted at a rapid rate in recent times. So, it should be considered as an urgent issue and it is the responsibility of journal editors to track misconduct by following Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) guidelines and making an effective strategy.

  "Abstract": "During the past twenty years, more than ninety retraction notices have been published in biomedical journals. These retractions constitute a unique body of literature that biomedical researchers, bibliographers, and librarians must monitor to reduce scientific use of retracted, invalid papers. An analysis of medical retraction notices shows that very few are prominent in style, format, or placement, in spite of authoritative publication standards formulated by the International Council of Medical Journal Editors. Although researchers are ultimately responsible for the validity of the information they cite in their own publications, biomedical librarians are in a unique position to educate their patrons regarding retracted papers.",

One way is to mount displays on biomedical retractions, either in library display cases or on bulletin boards. Many libraries publish a newsletter or acquistions list that could include an article on the dangers of citing works that may have been retracted. Finally, a list of retracted papers may be obtained from MEDLINE and kept current with periodic updates; every health sciences library should make such a list available for the patron who needs to check the refrences of a paper about to go to the press.\" pg 332",

  "Abstract": "Since published acknowledgements of scientific misconduct are a species of image restoration, common strategies for responding publicly to accusations can be expected: from sincere apologies to ritualistic apologies. This study is a rhetorical examination of these strategies as they are reflected in choices in language: it compares the published retractions and letters of apology with the letters that charge misconduct. The letters are examined for any shifts in language between the charge of misconduct and the response to the charge in order to assess whether the apology was sincere or ritualistic. The results indicate that although most authors’ published acknowledgments of scientific misconduct seem to minimize culpability by means of the strategic use of language, their resulting ritualistic apologies often still satisfy in some way the accusers’ (and thus their community’s) concerns.",

  "Abstract": "Background Measures to ensure research integrity have been widely discussed due to the social, economic and scientific impact of research integrity. In the past few years, financial support for health research in emerging countries has steadily increased, resulting in a growing number of scientific publications. These achievements, however, have been accompanied by a rise in retracted publications followed by concerns about the quality and reliability of such publications. Objective This systematic review aimed to investigate the profile of medical and life sciences research retractions from authors affiliated with Brazilian academic institutions. The chronological trend between publication and retraction date, reasons for the retraction, citation of the article after the retraction, study design, and the number of retracted publications by author and affiliation were assessed. Additionally, the quality, availability and accessibility of data regarding retracted papers from the publishers are described. Methods Two independent reviewers searched for articles that had been retracted since 2004 via PubMed, Web of Science, Biblioteca Virtual em Saúde (BVS) and Google Scholar databases. Indexed keywords from Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and Descritores em Ciências da Saúde (DeCS) in Portuguese, English or Spanish were used. Data were also collected from the Retraction Watch website (www.retractionwatch.com). This study was registered with the PROSPERO systematic review database (CRD42017071647). Results A final sample of 65 articles was retrieved from 55 different journals with reported impact factors ranging from 0 to 32.86, with a median value of 4.40 and a mean of 4.69. The types of documents found were erratum (1), retracted articles (3), retracted articles with a retraction notice (5), retraction notices with erratum (3), and retraction notices (45). The assessment of the Retraction Watch website added 8 articles that were not identified by the search strategy using the bibliographic databases. The retracted publications covered a wide range of study designs. Experimental studies (40) and literature reviews (15) accounted for 84.6% of the retracted articles. Within the field of health and life sciences, medical science was the field with the largest number of retractions (34), followed by biological sciences (17). Some articles were retracted for at least two distinct reasons (13). Among the retrieved articles, plagiarism was the main reason for retraction (60%). Missing data were found in 57% of the retraction notices, which was a limitation to this review. In addition, 63% of the articles were cited after their retraction. Conclusion Publications are not retracted solely for research misconduct but also for honest error. Nevertheless, considering authors affiliated with Brazilian institutions, this review concluded that most of the retracted health and life sciences publications were retracted due to research misconduct. Because the number of publications is the most valued indicator of scientific productivity for funding and career progression purposes, a systematic effort from the national research councils, funding agencies, universities and scientific journals is needed to avoid an escalating trend of research misconduct. More investigations are needed to comprehend the underlying factors of research misconduct and its increasing manifestation. © 2019 Stavale et al.

  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clinical papers so flawed that they are eventually retracted may put patients at risk. Patient risk could arise in a retracted primary study or in any secondary study that draws ideas or inspiration from a primary study. METHODS: To determine how many patients were put at risk, we evaluated 788 retracted English-language papers published from 2000 to 2010, describing new research with humans or freshly derived human material. These primary papers-together with all secondary studies citing them-were evaluated using ISI Web of Knowledge. Excluded from study were 468 basic science papers not studying fresh human material; 88 reviews presenting older data; 22 case reports; 7 papers retracted for journal error and 23 papers unavailable on Web of Knowledge. Overall, 180 retracted primary papers (22.8%) met the inclusion criteria. Subjects enrolled and patients treated in 180 primary studies and 851 secondary studies were combined. RESULTS: Retracted papers were cited over 5000 times, with 93% of citations being research related, suggesting that ideas promulgated in retracted papers can influence subsequent research. Over 28 000 subjects were enrolled-and 9189 patients were treated-in 180 retracted primary studies. Over 400 000 subjects were enrolled-and 70 501 patients were treated-in 851 secondary studies which cited a retracted paper. Papers retracted for fraud (n=70) treated more patients per study (p<0.01) than papers retracted for error (n=110). CONCLUSIONS: Many patients are put at risk by retracted studies. These are conservative estimates, as only patients enrolled in published clinical studies were tallied.",

  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Scientific papers are retracted for many reasons including fraud (data fabrication or falsification) or error (plagiarism, scientific mistake, ethical problems). Growing attention to fraud in the lay press suggests that the incidence of fraud is increasing. METHODS: The reasons for retracting 742 English language research papers retracted from the PubMed database between 2000 and 2010 were evaluated. Reasons for retraction were initially dichotomised as fraud or error and then analysed to determine specific reasons for retraction. RESULTS: Error was more common than fraud (73.5% of papers were retracted for error (or an undisclosed reason) vs 26.6% retracted for fraud). Eight reasons for retraction were identified; the most common reason was scientific mistake in 234 papers (31.5%), but 134 papers (18.1%) were retracted for ambiguous reasons. Fabrication (including data plagiarism) was more common than text plagiarism. Total papers retracted per year have increased sharply over the decade (r=0.96; p<0.001), as have retractions specifically for fraud (r=0.89; p<0.001). Journals now reach farther back in time to retract, both for fraud (r=0.87; p<0.001) and for scientific mistakes (r=0.95; p<0.001). Journals often fail to alert the naive reader; 31.8% of retracted papers were not noted as retracted in any way. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of misconduct appear to be higher than in the past. This may reflect either a real increase in the incidence of fraud or a greater effort on the part of journals to police the literature. However, research bias is rarely cited as a reason for retraction.",

  "Abstract": "Background Papers retracted for fraud (data fabrication or data falsification) may represent a deliberate effort to deceive, a motivation fundamentally different from papers retracted for error. It is hypothesised that fraudulent authors target journals with a high impact factor (IF), have other fraudulent publications, diffuse responsibility across many co-authors, delay retracting fraudulent papers and publish from countries with a weak research infrastructure. Methods All 788 English language research papers retracted from the PubMed database between 2000 and 2010 were evaluated. Data pertinent to each retracted paper were abstracted from the paper and the reasons for retraction were derived from the retraction notice and dichotomised as fraud or error. Data for each retracted article were entered in an Excel spreadsheet for analysis. Results Journal IF was higher for fraudulent papers (p<0.001). Roughly 53% of fraudulent papers were written by a first author who had written other retracted papers ('repeat offender'), whereas only 18% of erroneous papers were written by a repeat offender (chi=88.40; p<0.0001). Fraudulent papers had more authors (p<0.001) and were retracted more slowly than erroneous papers (p<0.005). Surprisingly, there was significantly more fraud than error among retracted papers from the USA (chi(2)=8.71; p<0.05) compared with the rest of the world. Conclusions This study reports evidence consistent with the 'deliberate fraud' hypothesis. The results suggest that papers retracted because of data fabrication or falsification represent a calculated effort to deceive. It is inferred that such behaviour is neither naive, feckless nor inadvertent.",

  "Abstract": "Retractions in the medical literature may be associated with scientific misconduct, but it is unclear how to prevent misinformation from permeating the medical literature. If misinformation is due to inadvertent (random) error--rather than to deliberate (nonrandom) fraud--then it may not be possible to prevent misinformation. I hypothesized that misconduct severe enough to result in article retraction reflects inadvertent error and should be randomly distributed in the literature. I evaluated all English-language research articles retracted in the PubMed database from 2000 to 2010. Of 4.8 million articles published, a total of 788 (0.016%) were retracted; for every 6,109 articles published, 1 article was retracted, suggesting that misinformation is rare. However, there are striking trends in retraction. In 2000, 4 articles were retracted and the longest time to retraction was 8 months; in 2004, 49 articles were retracted and the longest time to retraction was 50 months; in 2009, 184 articles were retracted and the longest time to retraction was 117 months. Furthermore, retractions are not randomly distributed in the literature. Retractions tend to appear in journals with an impact factor significantly above average. Retractions are also significantly clustered in a specific subset of journals and are written by a specific subset of \"repeat offender\" authors. That retractions are not random suggests that scientific misconduct by some authors is deliberate and could potentially be prevented. Science is a deeply collaborative effort involving first authors, coauthors, editors, referees, and peers, and all parties must share responsibility for maintaining scientific integrity.",

Therefore, arti- cles that were retracted were published in journals with a signifcantly higher impact factor (t =5.03; P <.001). The average impact factor for journals with a retracted article in the basic science category was 8.16 (±9.64), which was signifcantly higher than the impact factor for journals with a retracted arti- cle in the clinical science (t =3.22; P <0.005) or clinical trials (t =1.92; P <0.05) categories.

  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Medical research so flawed as to be retracted may put patients at risk by influencing treatments. OBJECTIVE: To explore hypotheses that more patients are put at risk if a retracted paper appears in a journal with a high impact factor (IF) so that the paper is widely read; is written by a 'repeat offender' author who has produced other retracted research; or is a clinical trial. METHODS: English language papers (n=788) retracted from the PubMed database between 2000 and 2010 were evaluated. Only those papers retracting research with humans or freshly derived human material were included; 180 retracted primary papers (22.8%) met inclusion criteria. Subjects enrolled and patients treated were tallied, both in the retracted primary studies and in 851 secondary studies that cited a retracted primary paper. RESULTS: Retracted papers published in high-IF journals were cited more often (p=0.0004) than those in low-IF journals, but there was no difference between high- and low-IF papers in subjects enrolled or patients treated. Retracted papers published by 'repeat offender' authors did not enrol more subjects or treat more patients than papers by one-time offenders, nor was there a difference in number of citations. However, retracted clinical trials treated more patients (p=0.0002) and inspired secondary studies that put more patients at risk (p=0.0019) than did other kinds of medical research. CONCLUSIONS: If the goal is to minimise risk to patients, the appropriate focus is on clinical trials. Clinical trials form the foundation of evidence-based medicine; hence, the integrity of clinical trials must be protected",

  "Abstract": "Background The number of retracted scientific publications has risen sharply, but it is unclear whether this reflects an increase in publication of flawed articles or an increase in the rate at which flawed articles are withdrawn. Methods and Findings We examined the interval between publication and retraction for 2,047 retracted articles indexed in PubMed. Time-to-retraction (from publication of article to publication of retraction) averaged 32.91 months. Among 714 retracted articles published in or before 2002, retraction required 49.82 months; among 1,333 retracted articles published after 2002, retraction required 23.82 months (p\\textless0.0001). This suggests that journals are retracting papers more quickly than in the past, although recent articles requiring retraction may not have been recognized yet. To test the hypothesis that time-to-retraction is shorter for articles that receive careful scrutiny, time-to-retraction was correlated with journal impact factor (IF). Time-to-retraction was significantly shorter for high-IF journals, but only ∼1% of the variance in time-to-retraction was explained by increased scrutiny. The first article retracted for plagiarism was published in 1979 and the first for duplicate publication in 1990, showing that articles are now retracted for reasons not cited in the past. The proportional impact of authors with multiple retractions was greater in 1972–1992 than in the current era (p\\textless0.001). From 1972–1992, 46.0% of retracted papers were written by authors with a single retraction; from 1993 to 2012, 63.1% of retracted papers were written by single-retraction authors (p\\textless0.001). Conclusions The increase in retracted articles appears to reflect changes in the behavior of both authors and institutions. Lower barriers to publication of flawed articles are seen in the increase in number and proportion of retractions by authors with a single retraction. Lower barriers to retraction are apparent in an increase in retraction for “new” offenses such as plagiarism and a decrease in the time-to-retraction of flawed work.",

  "Abstract": "The number of retracted scientific articles has been increasing. Most retractions are associated with research misconduct, entailing financial costs to funding sources and damage to the careers of those committing misconduct. We sought to calculate the magnitude of these effects. Data relating to retracted manuscripts and authors found by the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) to have committed misconduct were reviewed from public databases. Attributable costs of retracted manuscripts, and publication output and funding of researchers found to have committed misconduct were determined. We found that papers retracted due to misconduct accounted for approximately $58 million in direct funding by the NIH between 1992 and 2012, less than 1% of the NIH budget over this period. Each of these articles accounted for a mean of $392,582 in direct costs (SD $423,256). Researchers experienced a median 91.8% decrease in publication output and large declines in funding after censure by the ORI.",

  "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether plagiarism is more prevalent in publications retracted from the medical literature when first authors are affiliated with lower-income countries versus higher-income countries. Secondary objectives included investigating other factors associated with plagiarism (e.g., national language of the first author's country affiliation, publication type, journal ranking). DESIGN: Systematic, controlled, retrospective, bibliometric study. DATA SOURCE: Retracted publications dataset in MEDLINE (search filters: English, human, January 1966-February 2008). DATA SELECTION: Retracted misconduct publications were classified according to the first author's country affiliation, country income level, and country national language, publication type, and ranking of the publishing journal. Standardised definitions and data collection tools were used; data were analysed (odds ratio [OR], 95% confidence limits [CL], chi-squared tests) by an independent academic statistician. RESULTS: Of the 213 retracted misconduct publications, 41.8% (89/213) were retracted for plagiarism, 52.1% (111/213) for falsification/fabrication, 2.3% (5/213) for author disputes, 2.3% (5/213) for ethical issues, and 1.4% (3/213) for unknown reasons. The OR (95% CL) of plagiarism retractions (other misconduct retractions as reference) were higher (P < 0.001) for first authors affiliated with lower-income versus higher-income countries (15.4 [4.5, 52.9]) and with non-English versus English national language countries (3.2 [1.8, 5.7]), for non-original research versus original research publications (8.4 [3.3, 21.3]), for case reports and series versus other original research types (4.2 [1.4, 13.0]), and for publications in low-ranked versus high-ranked journals (4.9 [2.4, 9.9]). Up until 2012, there were significantly (P < 0.007) fewer 'serial offenders' (first authors with >1 retraction) with publications retracted for plagiarism (11.5%, 9/78) than other types of misconduct (28.9%, 24/83). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate that publications retracted for plagiarism are significantly associated with first authors affiliated with lower-income countries. These findings have implications for developing appropriate evidence-based strategies and allocation of resources to help mitigate plagiarism misconduct.",

  "Abstract": "IMPORTANCE The number of citations can be used to show the influence of an article or to measure the validity of a research study. The article by Wakefield et al that fraudulently reported an association between vaccination and autism continues to accumulate citations even after it was retracted. OBJECTIVES To examine the characteristics of citations from scholarly literature that reference the 1998 article by Wakefield et al and to investigate whether authors are accurately citing retracted references. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this cross-sectional bibliographic analysis of the scholarly publications that cited a 1998 article by Wakefield et al, cited references were collected from a Web of Science Core Collection search performed on March 11, 2019. A total of 1211 articles were identified, with 58 citing works excluded because they were non-English-language publications or the citation to the study by Wakefield et al could not be located by reviewers. Citing works consisted of books, research articles, letters, editorials, news items, and other scholarly literature. Citations to the article by Wakefield et al were identified and analyzed by 2 reviewers in a blinded screening. Reviewers assigned a characteristic to each citation and indicated whether the retraction was documented. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The characteristics of citations to the article by Wakefield et al, were categorized as negative, affirmative, or contrastive; if not, persuasive; and if not, assumptive, perfunctory, methodologic, or conceptual. Whether the partial retraction or notice of retraction was included in the citing work was also documented. RESULTS Among the 1153 citing works included in this analysis, the most common citation characteristics were negative (838 [72.7%]) followed by perfunctory (106 [9.2%]) and affirmative (94 [8.2%]). A total of 123 of 322 citing works (38.2%) published between 2005 and 2010 documented the partial retraction. After the notof retraction was published in 2010, the percentage of citing works that documented the partial retraction and/or notice of retraction between 2011 and 2018 increased to 360 of 502 (71.7%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Since the article by Wakefield et al was initially published, authors have mostly negated the findings of the study. A significant number of authors did not document retractions of the article by Wakefield et al. The findings suggest that improvements are needed from publishers, bibliographic databases, and citation management software to ensure that retracted articles are accurately documented.",

  "Abstract": "This article analyses 131 articles that have been retracted from peer-reviewed journals in business and management studies. We also draw from six in-depth interviews: three with journal editors involved in retractions, two with coauthors of papers retracted because a fellow author committed research fraud, and one with a former academic found guilty of research fraud. Our aim is to promote debate about the causes and consequences of research misconduct and to suggest possible remedies. Drawing on corruption theory, we suggest that a range of institutional, environmental, and behavioral factors interacts to provide incentives that sustain research misconduct. We explore the research practices that have prompted retractions. We contend that some widely used, but questionable research practices, should be challenged so as to promote stronger commitment to research integrity and to deter misconduct. To this end, we propose eleven recommendations for action by authors, editors, publishers, and the broader scientific community.",

The burden of proof regarding data authen-\nticity and analysis needs to shift from those with questions to\nthose who produce the results (Clark, 2017). This would act\nas a bulwark against the perpetration of data fraud, or poor\nanalysis, and enable journals to give clearer justifications for\nretractions.\"\n\"2. Clarify responsibility for data collection. The interview data\nshow that determining responsibility for research fraud is a\nfraught and stressful process for editors and authors. To\nrequire each author of multiauthored papers to be fully\nresponsible for every aspect of the work, including data col-\nlection, would be debilitating. However, some leading jour-\nnals, such as the Journal of Accounting Research (JAR), now\nrequire clear identification of the authors responsible for data\ncollection and management, description of how data were\nobtained, and statements regarding which author(s) can con-\nfirm data authenticity (see http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.\nezproxy.canterbury.ac.nz/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1475-\n679X/homepage/ForAuthors.html). We suggest that JAR’s\nprotocols become standard practice in respect of all papers\nsubmitted in business and management studies. This would\ncompel coauthors to be more interested in the authenticity of\ndata, and enable investigations of data fraud to focus closely\non the sources of suspected problems.\n3. Specify all statistical analyses that were conducted. Authors\nshould divulge this information to enable readers to more\naccurately assess the results of the analyses reported. This\nwould also encourage authors to engage in THARKing rather\nthan HARKing.\"\n\"4. Require journals to make clearer statements of reasons for\nretraction. Twelve papers in our database were retracted\nwith no clear reason provided. This serves no obvious aca-\ndemic interest. Rather, it occludes the prevalence of\nresearch misconduct and prevents other scholars learning\nfrom what has gone wrong. Clearer disclosures of reasons\nfor retraction should be provided, as Cox et al. (2018) have\nargued. Failing to do so may protect the reputation of\noffenders and ensure they are free to continue publishing.\"\n\"The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors’\n(ICMJE) policy on “Scientific Misconduct, Expressions of\nConcern, and Retraction” merits widespread consideration.\nIt states:\"\n\"5. Investigate the whole body of work of authors who have\npapers retracted for fraud. Our database contains multiple\nretractions from serial offenders who nevertheless still have\nmany other papers in the public domain. A mandatory\nreview of the entire body of published work of an author\nfound guilty of research fraud in more than one paper\nshould be conducted by publishing houses and scholarly\nacademies to help identify whether the author’s other\npapers are fraudulent.\"\n\"6. Develop clearer rules for disclosure of penalties and conflicts of\ninterest. We suggest that journals should insist on full disclo-\nsure of any consulting relationships between authors and\nbusiness interests. Nondisclosure of such relationships is\nunethical and likely to enhance the bias in favor of publishing\nonly positive results. Such bias encourages egregious forms\nof p-hacking. It would be beneficial if business and manage-\nment studies journals adopted an approach similar to that of\nthe American Economic Association:\"\n\"7. Label all retracted papers as “retracted.” The failure to\nclearly mark retracted papers as “retracted” contributes to the\ncontinued citation of defective work. There are 18 such\npapers in our database. By the time this article is published\nthey will most likely have accumulated even more citations\nthan they currently have. As a condition of being listed as a\nsignatory to Committee on Publication Ethics’ (COPE)\nguidelines, journals should be required to clearly label all\npages of all retracted papers as “retracted.”\"\n\"8.

There\nneeds to be greater recognition that p-hacking constitutes a\nfundamental distortion of data, often amounts to outright\nmisrepresentation, and is tantamount to misconduct. Rela-\nbeling it as a “deceptive research practice” rather than one\nthat is merely “questionable” would encourage a shift in\nmind-sets away from condoning its use. This leads to our\nnext recommendation.\"\n\"9. Substitute the term “deceptive research practice” for “QRPs.”\nGreater use of the term deceptive research practice would\nsend a much less ambiguous message about research integ-\nrity to the academic community. This would help reverse\nthe drift to the normalization of research misconduct.\nGreater use of the adjective “deceptive” offers a clearer\nway of communicating the unacceptability of practices that\nhave become far too common (such as p-hacking and\nHARKing).\"\n\"10. Develop research misconduct policies. Resnik, Rasmus-\nsen, and Kissling (2015) found that 22 of the top 40\nresearch-active countries had research misconduct policies.\nEncouragingly, other countries are following suit. While\nU.S. universities generally have research integrity officers,\nthis is not standard practice elsewhere. This absence of\nresearch misconduct policies hinders the detection of aca-\ndemic wrongdoing and produces inconsistencies in how it\nis treated. Explicit research misconduct policies should be\ndeveloped to provide a point of access for whistle-blowers\nand make it harder to ignore allegations of misconduct.\nThis would further reduce the possibility of research mis-\nconduct being ignored, in an attempt to avoid institutional\nnaming and shaming.\"\n\"11. Strengthen the education of PhD students to include more\nexplicit, detailed, and frequent consideration of poor research\npractices and the need for ethical research. In Tables 1 and 2,\nwe cited studies which showed that PhD students often\nobserve poor research practices. If these are copied by stu-\ndents during their training and they continue with defective\npractices, they risk damaging the quality of future research\nand the derailing of their careers if detected. We need better\ntraining in what constitute appropriate and ethical research\nmethods at this early stage of their careers. Of necessity,\nthis should include more explicit reflection on the perils of\nsuch practices as p-hacking and HARKing than is present at\nthe moment.\"\n\"Academics should be encouraged to be committed to research\nof the highest integrity (Adler & Hansen, 2012). This means\"\n\"focusing afresh on the motivations of disinterested inquiry\nand curiosity that are the mainstay of good research, rather\nthan seeing research mainly in terms of career advancement\nand publication as “a game” that we play to that end. We\nshould strengthen our collective commitment to research\nintegrity and help to prevent research from becoming a cor-\nrupt game that damages the scholarly community and, ulti-\nmately, our wider society.[¬e]\"",

  "Abstract": "Objective: The aim was to evaluate papers retracted due to falsification in high-impact journals. Study Design and Setting: We selected articles retracted due to allegations of falsification in January 1, 1980 to March 1, 2006 from journals with impact factor > 10 and > 30,000 annual citations. We evaluated characteristics of these papers and misconduct-involved authors and assessed whether they correlated with time to retraction. We also compared retracted articles vs. matched nonretracted articles in the same journals. Results: Fourteen eligible journals had 63 eligible retracted articles. Median time from publication to retraction was 28 months; it was 79 months for articles where a senior researcher was implicated in the misconduct vs. 22 months when junior researchers were implicated (log-rank P < 0.001). For the 25 implicated authors, the median time from the first publication of a fraudulent paper to the first retraction was 34 months, again with a clear difference according to researcher rank (log-rank P = 0.001). Retracted articles didn't differ from matched nonretracted papers in citations received within 12 months, number of authors, country, funding, or field, but were twofold more likely to have multinational authorship (P = 0.049). Conclusions: Retractions due to falsification can take a long time, especially when senior researchers are implicated. Fraudulent articles are not obviously distinguishable from nonfraudulent ones.

Senior rank and last author position were strongly correlated (SpearmanÕs correla- tion 5 0.74, P ! 0.001). A few articles were retracted very soon, regardless of rank or position, but after the Þrst year articles where the main implicated author was a senior researcher took much longer to be retracted than articles where the main implicated perpetrator was a junior researcher (Fig. 1a). The median time to retraction was 79 months for articles where senior researchers were impli- cated vs. 22 months when junior researchers were impli- cated. All of the papers where senior researchers had been implicated were retracted in the last decade (all in the last 3 years, with two exceptions). The median time from publication to retraction of the 46 articles that these authors had published in nonetop-cited journals was 61 months (IQR: 23e86). Senior authors had a median time to retraction of 79 months vs. 18 months for junior investigators. There was no statistically signiÞcant dif- ference for the time it took to retract fraudulent articles in the top-cited journals vs. nonetop-cited journals for senior and junior researchers (P 5 0.88 and P 5 0.15, respectively). There was a suggestion that articles in the life sciences were also more slowly retracted than articles in physics (P 5 0.050), but all 16 physics articles originated from a single investigator. There was also a possibly slower retraction pace of European articles vs. articles originating from the United States or other countries (median time 34 vs. 24 vs. 22), but this did not reach formal statistical sig- niÞcance (P 5 0.084). The time to retraction was not signif- icantly affected by the number of authors (log-rank P 5 0.47, categorization based on median), origin from many countries vs. one (log-rank P 5 0.90), and number of citations received in the Þrst year (log-rank P 5 0.65, categorization based on median of citation count). Articles with more citations at 12e36 months were slower to be retracted (log-rank P ! 0.001, categorization based on me- dian of citation count), but this was driven by the 16 articles of the one physicist that were retracted very fast and were generally not cited after their retraction.\"\n\"When only life science articles were examined (exclud- ing the one physicist with 16 retracted articles), the median survival time of eventually retracted articles from top-cited journals was 29 months (IQR: 12e69), with 77% surviving 0 . 0 0 0 . 2 5 0 . 5 0 0 . 7 5 1 . 0 0 S u r v i v a l 0 50 100 150 200 Time-to-retraction (in months) a b 0 . 0 0 0 . 2 5 0 . 5 0 0 . 7 5 1 . 0 0 S u r v i v a l 0 50 100 150 200 Time-to-first-retraction (in months) log-rank p<0.001 log-rank p=0.001 junior rank senior rank junior rank senior rank Fig. 1.

Apparently there has been strong resistance to retracting papers where senior investigators were the cul- prits. Papers where senior scientists have been implicated in the misconduct have taken on average over 6 years to be retracted, whereas most papers where junior researchers were the culprits were retracted much sooner. The same dif- ference is seen when we examine the full retraction history of fraudulent authors. Papers that were eventually retracted were more likely to involve multinational authorship, but otherwise they could not be differentiated on any grounds from others published in the neighboring pages of the same journals.\"\n\"There are no strong alert signs to hint that a paper is fraudulent. We found a potential relationship between retraction and multinational authorship. This should be in- terpreted with caution, given the borderline statistical sig- niÞcance. If true, it may suggest that falsiÞcation may be easier to reveal when collaborators from many countries are involved in the scientiÞc work. It is less likely that multinational studies have higher rates of falsiÞcation.\"\n\"Perhaps more importantly, we acknowledge that our analysis deals with the visible tip of an iceberg. We suspect that a large number of fraudulent articles are not recognized as such and several that might have been probed seriously for misconduct at some point were not formally retracted eventually. \"\n\"Retracting a paper can be an\nextremely convoluted, charged process, especially when\nfalsiﬁcation is implicated. Journals may occasionally be\nslow and hesitant to retract papers\"\n\"It is even possible, although not very likely, that no\nscientiﬁc misconduct may have occurred for some of these\narticles and the authors may have been blamed in error.\nHowever, it is more likely that several other fraudulent\narticles still remain untouched in the literature.\nJunior researchers may be viewed more critically than es-\ntablished researchers, if they present spectacular ﬁndings\nand/or make their way into high-impact journals.\"\n\"Senior investigators are largely the auditors of their\nown labs and teams, so they may hide their misconduct better.[¬e]\"",

  "Abstract": "Information and communication technology (ICT) is not an unalloyed advantage when talking about propagation and expansion of scholarly knowledge. The same ICT which acts as an enabler to research in the comfort of one's study and preferred environment makes the researchers with weak conscience vulnerable to the temptation of research misconduct. Surprisingly, the same technology acts as a sentinel, helping academe nail such transgressions and withdrawing them or taking the contextual corrective recourse. Of late, there has been a substantial increase in the invalidation and withdrawal of research articles based on invalid data and findings. One analysed the retraction notices of 249 annulled articles, indexed in Scopus, during the period, 2000-2017. The study has highlighted that the majority of the retracted notices do not have explicit reasons for revoking the findings of research articles. It has stressed upon the immensely pivotal role of libraries in spreading awareness and sensitising researchers with regard to adherence to norms, ethics and policies of scholarly communication.",

  "Abstract": "Retraction is the withdrawal of published article after it is found that the authors did not ensure integrity in conducting and reporting their research activities. The bibliometric information of 4716 document categorised as retractions in Science Citation Index, Web of Science was downloaded and analysed to understand trend, pattern and reasons of retraction. The results showed that retractions had increased during the ten-year period, 2008-2017. The main reasons for retractions were plagiarism, falsified data, manipulation of images and figures. It was also found that just 40 out of 4716 retraction notices had explicitly stated reasons for retracting the published articles. The open access journals had more number of retractions as compared to subscription based journals. The study will guide library professionals and research scholars towards a better comprehension of the reasons behind retractions in science discipline in the ten-year period. They would be better equipped to steer clear of inauthentic publications in their citations and references.",

  "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: In about one in 10,000 cases, a published article is retracted. This very often means that the results it reports are flawed. Several authors have voiced concerns about the presence of retracted research in the memory of science. In particular, a retracted result is propagated by citing it. In the published literature, many instances are given of retracted articles that are cited both before and after their retraction. Even worse is the possibility that these articles in turn are cited in such a way that the retracted result is propagated further. METHODS: We have conducted a case study to find out how a retracted article is cited and whether retracted results are propagated through indirect citations. We have constructed the entire citation network for this case. RESULTS: We show that directly citing articles is an important source of propagation of retracted research results. In contrast, in our case study, indirect citations do not contribute to the propagation of the retracted result. CONCLUSIONS: While admitting the limitations of a study involving a single case, we think there are reasons for the non-contribution of indirect citations that hold beyond our case study.",

  "Abstract": "While researchers with retracted papers - publications that are withdrawn because of significant errors or scientific misconduct - carry a permanent stain on their publishing records, understanding the causes and initiators of such retractions can shed a different light on the matter. This paper, based on a random sample of 2,046 retracted papers, which were published between 1975 and 2019, extracted from Retraction Watch and the websites of major publishers, shows that 53% of the retraction notices do not specify who initiated the retraction. Nearly 10% of the retraction notes either omit or do not contain information related to reasons for retractions. Furthermore, most of the retracted papers in our sample have no limitation section; those who do are commonly unhelpful or irrelevant. The results carry three implications for scientific transparency: retraction notices need to be more informative; limitation sections ought to be a required and even an open section of all published articles; and finally, promoting 'heroic acts' in science can positively change the current publishing culture.",

  "Abstract": "Background Journal editors are responsible for what they publish and therefore have a duty to correct the record if published work is found to be unreliable. One method for such correction is retraction of an article. Anecdotal evidence suggested a lack of consistency in journal policies and practices regarding retraction. In order to develop guidelines, we reviewed retractions in Medline to discover how and why articles were retracted. Methods We retrieved all available Medline retractions from 2005 to 2008 and a one-in-three random selection of those from 1988 to 2004. This yielded 312 retractions (from a total of 870). Details of the retraction including the reason for retraction were recorded by two investigators. Results Medline retractions have increased sharply since 1980 and currently represent 0.02% of included articles. Retractions were issued by authors (63%), editors (21%), journals (6%), publishers (2%) and institutions (1%). Reasons for retraction included honest error or non-replicable findings (40%), research misconduct (28%), redundant publication (17%) and unstated/ unclear (5%). Some of the stated reasons might have been addressed by corrections. Conclusions Journals' retraction practices are not uniform. Some retractions fail to state the reason, and therefore fail to distinguish error from misconduct. We have used our findings to inform guidelines on retractions.",

  "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Despite the increasing awareness of scientific fraud, no attempt has been made to assess its prevalence in neurosurgery. The aim of our review was to assess the chronologic trend, reasons, research type/design, and country of origin of retracted neurosurgical publications. METHODS: Three independent reviewers searched the EMBASE and MEDLINE databases using neurosurgical keywords for retracted articles from 1995 to 2016. Archives of retracted articles (retractionwatch.com) and the independent Web sites of neurosurgical journals were also searched. Data including the journal, impact factor, reason for retraction, country of origin, and citations were extracted. RESULTS: A total of 97 studies were included for data extraction. Journal impact factor ranged from 0.57 to 35.03. Most studies (61) were retracted within the last 5 years. The most common reason for retraction was because of a duplicated publication found elsewhere (26), followed closely by plagiarism (22), or presenting fraudulent data (14). Other reasons included scientific errors/mistakes, author misattribution, and compromised peer review. Articles originated from several countries and some were widely cited. CONCLUSIONS: Retractions of neurosurgical publications are increasing significantly, mostly because of issues of academic integrity, including duplicate publishing and plagiarism. Implementation of more transparent data-sharing repositories and thorough screening of data before manuscript submission, as well as additional educational programs for new researchers, may help mitigate these issues in the future.",

There were 14 articles for which no reason for the retraction was provided. Most retraction notices gave only a single reason for the retraction of an article.

  "Abstract": "The number of articles published in open access journals (OAJs) has increased dramatically in recent years. Simultaneously, the quality of publications in these journals has been called into question. Few studies have explored the retraction rate from OAJs. The purpose of the current study was to determine the reasons for retractions of articles from OAJs in biomedical research. The Medline database was searched through PubMed to identify retracted publications in OAJs. The journals were identified by the Directory of Open Access Journals. Data were extracted from each retracted article, including the time from publication to retraction, causes, journal impact factor, and country of origin. Trends in the characteristics related to retraction were determined. Data from 621 retracted studies were included in the analysis. The number and rate of retractions have increased since 2010. The most common reasons for retraction are errors (148), plagiarism (142), duplicate publication (101), fraud/suspected fraud (98) and invalid peer review (93). The number of retracted articles from OAJs has been steadily increasing. Misconduct was the primary reason for retraction. The majority of retracted articles were from journals with low impact factors and authored by researchers from China, India, Iran, and the USA.",

  "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to characterize retracted studies within the field of radiation oncology. METHODS: Computerized searches were performed in Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Ovid EMBASE and The Cochrane Library through to May 2017 looking for retracted studies using the terms 'retraction note', 'retracted note', 'withdrawn' and 'radiotherapy', 'radiation oncology'. Additional studies were identified by hand-searching 10 discipline-specific journals. Two authors independently screened papers, and then extracted author demographics, journal characteristics and retraction-specific variables. RESULTS: Of the 58 studies identified, the most common reason for retraction was misconduct (43%), methodological error (21%), authorship issues (5%), unknown causes (5%) and journal (administrative) errors (3%). A total of 13 systematic reviews or protocols (22%) were withdrawn from The Cochrane Library for being out-of-date or redundant. All but one retracted study and retraction notice was available in portable document format respectively. Of the 57 retrieved papers, 79% were identified as retracted via in-text notations or watermarks. Overall median time to retraction was 44 months (interquartile range [IQR] 11 to 98). However, 42 studies (72%) were still cited after retraction notices were published. CONCLUSION: A retracted study within the field of radiation oncology remains a relatively uncommon event. Although promising, our data suggest that the majority of these retracted articles continue to be cited as valid research. As such, there is still a need for clinicians to remain vigilant with their academic rigor and good clinical research practices. There is an urgent need for publication houses to foster universal publishing standards along with discipline-specific retraction guidelines.",

  "Abstract": "Objective.  —To determine whether scientists can detect fraudulent results in published research articles and to identify corrective measures that are most effective in purging fraudulent results from the literature.\r\rDesign.  —Retrospective case-control study comparing articles by an author known to have published fraudulent articles, Robert A. Slutsky, MD, to a set of control articles. The number of non-self-citations received by each article during each calendar year (1979 through 1990) was counted. The citation numbers were transformed into scores. Each Slutsky article was assigned a score between 1 and 3 based on the number of citations received by the Slutsky article and each of its assigned control articles. Average citation numbers and scores were tracked for each year during the 11-year study period.\r\rResults.  —Before Slutsky's work was publicly questioned (1975 to 1985), scientists cited his articles as frequently as they cited control articles. After Slutsky's work was questioned and reports were published in the news media (1985), scientists cited his articles less frequently than they cited control articles. Citations decreased further after the University of California—San Diego published a review of the validity of Slutsky's work in 1987. Citations did not decrease after the appearance of retractions in print or in MEDLINE.\r\rConclusion.  —Scientists do not, and probably cannot, identify published articles that are fraudulent. However, when alerted to the presence of fraudulent results in the literature, the scientific community responds by reducing the number of citations of the tainted articles. In the Slutsky case, general news articles and the three reviews published by the University of California—San Diego were most effective and retractions were least effective in purging fraudulent results from the literature.(JAMA. 1994;272:170-173)",

  "Abstract": "Published articles may be retracted when their findings are no longer considered reliable due to honest error, publication misconduct, or research misconduct. This article focuses on the case of a single serial violator of research and publication ethics in anesthesiology and critical care, which is widely publicized. A chain of events led to detection of misconduct that had substantial impact on the evidence base for the safety of hydroxyethyl starch, an intravenous artificial colloid solution, which is reflected in current guidelines on fluid management and volume resuscitation. As citations to retracted works continue to be a cause for concern, this article reviews the retraction status of this author's published articles to determine whether sufficient action has been taken to retract his body of work. Results show that retraction practices are not uniform and that guidelines for retraction are still not being fully implemented, resulting in retractions of insufficient quantity and quality. As retractions continue to emerge for the author's publications, with ten more since 2011, and as they are generally increasing, these data on retractions not only provide findings of misconduct, but also allow us to make inferences about ongoing weaknesses in the system of scientific literature.",

  "Abstract": "Editors have a responsibility to retract seriously flawed articles from their journals. However, there appears to be little consistency in journals' policies or procedures for this. In a qualitative study, we therefore interviewed editors of science journals using semi-structured interviews to investigate their experience of retracting articles. We identified potential barriers to retraction, difficulties in the process and also sources of support and encouragement. Our findings have been used as the basis for guidelines developed by the Committee on Publication Ethics.",

The expert reported that there was clearly a signiﬁcant overlap in\ncontent.\n• The journal which had published the original paper was contacted, and a series\nof ‘conversations’ ensued by telephone and email (suggesting, as was admitted\nin the interview, that there was no procedure in place to handle this situation).\n• It was decided that the original journal should contact the authors. This too,\nhowever, necessitated further communication, as a form of wording had to be\nagreed by both journals’ editors;\n• The lead author was thus contacted, replied within 5 days, and admitted the\nmistake.[¬e]\"",

  "Abstract": "Background: Claims have been made that medical writers and the pharmaceutical industry are highly likely to have been involved in publications retracted for misconduct. Advocates of medical writers and the pharmaceutical industry have had limited evidence to counter such claims.\rPurpose and objective: We conducted the largest study to date on misconduct retractions to quantify, for the first time, how involved declared medical writers and the pharmaceutical industry have been in publications retracted for misconduct. Methods: We used PubMed (limits: English, human, 1966–2008) to identify publications retracted for misconduct or mistake. Standardized definitions and data collection tools were used (inter-rater reliability 1⁄4 100%). Mistake retractions served as the control group. An independent academic statistician analyzed the data.\rResults: Of the 463 retractions retrieved, 213 (46%) were misconduct retractions. Of the misconduct retractions, three (1.41%) involved declared writers, eight (3.76%) involved declared pharmaceutical sponsorship, and none (0.00%) involved both declared writers and pharmaceutical sponsorship. The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of a misconduct versus mistake retraction was 0.16 (0.05–0.57) for publications with declared writers and 0.25 (0.11–0.58) for papers with declared pharmaceutical sponsorship.\rConclusion: The involvement of declared medical writers or the pharmaceutical industry in misconduct retractions is very low. Our results can help writers and sponsors counter claims about unethical publication practices and can reinforce the value of appropriate disclosure.",

  "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to quantify how many publications retracted because of misconduct involved declared medical writers (i.e., not ghostwriters) or declared pharmaceutical industry support. The secondary objective was to investigate factors associated with misconduct retractions. DESIGN: A systematic, controlled, retrospective, bibliometric study. DATA SOURCE: Retracted publications dataset in the MEDLINE database. DATA SELECTION: PubMed was searched (Limits: English, human, January 1966 - February 2008) to identify publications retracted because of misconduct. Publications retracted because of mistake served as the control group. Standardized definitions and data collection tools were used, and data were analyzed by an independent academic statistician. RESULTS: Of the 463 retracted publications retrieved, 213 (46%) were retracted because of misconduct. Publications retracted because of misconduct rarely involved declared medical writers (3/213; 1.4%) or declared pharmaceutical industry support (8/213; 3.8%); no misconduct retractions involved both declared medical writers and the industry. Retraction because of misconduct, rather than mistake, was significantly associated with: absence of declared medical writers (odds ratio: 0.16; 95% confidence interval: 0.05-0.57); absence of declared industry involvement (0.25; 0.11-0.58); single authorship (2.04; 1.01-4.12); first author having at least one other retraction (2.05; 1.35-3.11); and first author affiliated with a low/middle income country (2.34; 1.18-4.63). The main limitations of this study were restricting the search to English-language and human research articles. CONCLUSIONS: Publications retracted because of misconduct rarely involved declared medical writers or declared pharmaceutical industry support. Increased attention should focus on factors that are associated with misconduct retractions.",

(2) Mistake: Defined as reported errors in sampling, pro- cedures, or data analysis; failure to reproduce findings or accidental omission of key information from meth- ods or analysis 4 . Mistake retractions served as the control group for comparisons with the misconduct group. Mistake retractions were identified using the same search strategy and were retrieved during the same time period. (3) Uncertain: Publications classified as uncertain could not be categorized as either misconduct or mistakes as the information provided in the retraction notice was unclear or incomplete 4 . (4) Journal error: Defined as an error by the journal lead- ing to the publications retraction (e.g., the publica- tion was inadvertently printed twice).[¬e]\"",

  "Abstract": "Retractions are rare in science, but there is growing concern about the impact retracted papers have. We present data on the retractions in the journal Science, between 1983 and 2017. Each year, approximately 2.6 papers are retracted; that is about 0.34% of the papers published in the journal. 30% of the retracted papers are retracted within 1year of publication. Some papers are retracted almost 12years after publication. 51% of the retracted papers are retracted due to honest mistakes. Smaller research teams of 2-4 scientists are responsible for a disproportionately larger share of the retracted papers especially when it comes to retractions due to honest mistakes. In 60% of thecases all authors sign the retraction notice.",

In fact, only 8 of the 762 Research Articles and Reports published in 2010 were single authored (that is about 1%). A little over half of the retracted papers were authored by collaborative teams of two to four scientists (47 out of 92 papers; 51%). The remaining 49% of the retracted articles were authored by teams ranging from 5 scientists to 26 scientists. See Fig. 3. The best \u001et curve is described by a power law, where y = 55.45x -1.319 and R 2 = 0.761. This distribution is not surprising, given that earlier research by Derek de Solla Price suggests that there are more publications by smaller research teams than larger research teams in science (de Solla Price 1963). Interestingly, although collaborative teams of two to four scientists are responsible for 51% of the retracted articles (47/92), such groups authored only about 29% of the articles published in Science, assuming 2010 is a typical year. See Fig. 4a, b. Thus, these smaller groups are more prone than larger research teams to publish articles that are ultimately retracted. Collaborative teams of \u001eve to seven scientists are responsible for roughly their share of the retracted articles. They were responsible for 30% of the publications, and 27% of the retracted articles (25/92).

  "Abstract": "When scientific articles are found to contain fabricated or plagiarized data, or to be invalidated by pervasive error, they are customarily withdrawn from the literature by published retractions. The effect of retraction was studied by citation analysis of 53 retracted biomedical articles. Two research questions were investigated: Does publication of a retraction depress the frequency of subsequent citation? and Are post-retraction citations negative, or are retracted papers cited in order to support or substantiate the assumptions or findings of the citing article? The first question was studied by comparing the number of citations that each article received during the two years before retraction to the number of citations received during the two years following retraction. A statistically significant difference was found between the number of pre-retraction citations (495) and the number of post-retraction citations (303). The difference remained statistically significant even after estimating the decline in citation frequency attributable to obsolescence. The second question was studied by citation context analysis of the 303 residual articles that had cited the retracted publications. The portions of the citing articles that referenced the retracted articles were classified by a subject specialist according to the typology of citation contexts developed by Chubin and Moitra. Citation contexts were found to be affirmative to a statistically significant extent. With ninety percent of the citations being affirmative, the retracted articles were cited as though they were still valid. The citing articles, whose authors were evidently unaware of the published retractions, were written in standard scientific languages; generally originated in the United States, Western Europe, or Scandinavia; and were published in relatively prestigious journals. A content analysis of retraction statements indicated that only 68 percent specified the reason for retraction, 45 percent were published prominently in the journal, and 40 percent identified the individual responsible for the error or misconduct. The continued, affirmative use of retracted articles suggests that some retractions are going unheeded, and that invalid information may be perpetuated through citation in subsequent articles.",

They also state that an electronic\njournal should, under no circumstances, remove an\narticle, as electronic articles should be stored in a\npermanent archive for historical record\"\n\"Similarly, the guidance from the Committee on\nPublication Ethics recommends that retracted articles\nshould be clearly identified in all electronic resources:\nspecifically that they (i) be labeled in such a way that\nthey are identified by bibliographic databases, (ii)\nappear in all electronic searches for the publication,\nand (iii) are clearly annotated as retracted on the\njournal’s own website [14].\"\n\"There is more work\nto be done in encouraging journals to follow current\nguidelines.

  "Abstract": "Unlike other academic publications whose authorship is eagerly claimed, the provenance of retraction notices (RNs) is often obscured presumably because the retraction of published research is associated with undesirable behavior and consequently carries negative consequences for the individuals involved. The ambiguity of authorship, however, has serious ethical ramifications and creates methodological problems for research on RNs that requires clear authorship attribution. This article reports a study conducted to identify RN textual features that can be used to disambiguate obscured authorship, ascertain the extent of authorship evasion in RNs from two disciplinary clusters, and determine if the disciplines varied in the distributions of different types of RN authorship. Drawing on a corpus of 370 RNs archived in the Web of Science for the hard discipline of Cell Biology and the soft disciplines of Business, Finance, and Management, this study has identified 25 types of textual markers that can be used to disambiguate authorship, and revealed that only 25.68% of the RNs could be unambiguously attributed to authors of the retracted articles alone or jointly and that authorship could not be determined for 28.92% of the RNs. Furthermore, the study has found marked disciplinary differences in the different categories of RN authorship. These results point to the need for more explicit editorial requirements about RN authorship and their strict enforcement.",

  "Abstract": "Objectives Despite the fact that research fraud and misconduct are under scrutiny in the field of orthopaedic research, little systematic work has been done to uncover and characterise the underlying reasons for academic retractions in this field. The purpose of this study was to determine the rate of retractions and identify the reasons for retracted publications in the orthopaedic literature. Methods Two reviewers independently searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (1995 to current) using MeSH keyword headings and the 'retracted' filter. We also searched an independent website that reports and archives retracted scientific publications (www.retractionwatch.com). Two reviewers independently extracted data including reason for retraction, study type, journal impact factor, and country of origin. Results One hundred and ten retracted studies were included for data extraction. The retracted studies were published in journals with impact factors ranging from 0.000 (discontinued journals) to 13.262. In the 20-year search window, only 25 papers were retracted in the first ten years, with the remaining 85 papers retracted in the most recent decade. The most common reasons for retraction were fraudulent data (29), plagiarism (25) and duplicate publication (20). Retracted articles have been cited up to 165 times (median 6; interquartile range 2 to 19). Conclusion The rate of retractions in the orthopaedic literature is increasing, with the majority of retractions attributed to academic misconduct and fraud. Orthopaedic retractions originate from numerous journals and countries, indicating that misconduct issues are widespread. The results of this study highlight the need to address academic integrity when training the next generation of orthopaedic investigators.",

  "Abstract": "In order to describe the impact of the retracted publications on the scientific community more comprehensively, this paper introduces the impact of retracted publications on technology, establishes the Multi-Dimensional Observation Framework of Retracted Publications from the five aspects, including Scientific impact, Scientists Impact, Technology Impact, Funding Impact and Altmetric Impact, and propose the use of multi-dimension bubble diagram and sanky diagram to show the multi-dimensional data. This paper takes all the retracted publications from the journal Cell as an example, using the observation framework to analyze them, and describes the impact of these papers from multiple dimensions. The results show that compared with the single dimension, the observation framework reveals the impact characteristics of retracted publications abundantly to some extent, and also expands the dimension of retracted publications' impact.",

  "Abstract": "Better understanding of research and publishing misconduct can improve strategies to mitigate their occurrence. In this study, we examine various trends among 2,375 articles retracted due to misconduct in all scholarly fields. Proportions of articles retracted due to “publication misconduct” (primarily plagiarism and duplicate publication) or “distrust data or interpretations” (primarily research artifacts and unexplained irreproducibility of data) differ significantly between PubMed (35 and 59 %, respectively) and non-PubMed (56 and 27 %) articles and between English- and non-English-speaking author affiliation countries. Retraction rates due to any form of misconduct, adjusted for the size of the literature in different disciplines, vary from 0.22 per 100,000 articles in the Humanities to 7.58 in Medicine and 7.69 in Chemistry. The annual rate of article retractions due to misconduct has increased exponentially since 2001, and the percentage of all retractions involving misconduct allegations has grown from 18.5–29.2 % for each year from 1990–1993 to 55.8–71.9 % for each year from 2007–2010. Despite these increases, the prominence of research integrity in the news media has not changed appreciably over the past 20 years. Articles retracted due to misconduct are found in all major scholarly disciplines. The higher rate of plagiarism among authors from non-English speaking countries may diminish if institutions improved their support for the writing of English manuscripts by their scholars. The training of junior scholars on proper codes of research (and publishing) conduct should be embraced by all disciplines, not just by biomedical fields where the perception of misconduct is high.",
